1
00:00:08,552 --> 00:00:09,696
<i>And that's your biggest worry?</i>

2
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,864
<i>Yes, any kind
of virus.</i>

3
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:13,348
<i>But most probably
something similar to influenza.</i>

4
00:00:13,432 --> 00:00:14,433
<i>Because of air travel.</i>

5
00:00:14,516 --> 00:00:15,474
<i>Through the air.</i>

6
00:00:15,475 --> 00:00:17,019
- Coughing...
- I'm sorry.

7
00:00:17,102 --> 00:00:18,812
I meant people. On planes.

8
00:00:18,896 --> 00:00:20,456
That was something you described
in your book.

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,442
Yes, a new virus
in Madagascar, say, could be in Chicago

10
00:00:23,525 --> 00:00:24,526
within a matter of weeks,

11
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:27,571
and we end up with a global pandemic.
Pan meaning "all."

12
00:00:27,654 --> 00:00:29,948
The whole world becomes sick
all at once.

13
00:00:31,283 --> 00:00:33,827
And, Dr. Neuman,
you're also an epidemiologist.

14
00:00:33,911 --> 00:00:34,912
I presume the prospect

15
00:00:34,995 --> 00:00:36,848
of a viral pandemic keeps you up
at night as well.

16
00:00:36,872 --> 00:00:38,165
- No.
- No?

17
00:00:38,248 --> 00:00:40,000
- No.
- All right, well, that's our show.

18
00:00:41,084 --> 00:00:43,879
No, mankind has been
at war with the virus from the start.

19
00:00:43,962 --> 00:00:47,174
Sometimes, millions of people die,
as in an actual war.

20
00:00:47,257 --> 00:00:49,676
But in the end, we always win.

21
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,013
Just to be clear, you do think
microorganisms pose a threat.

22
00:00:53,263 --> 00:00:55,057
Oh, in the most dire terms.

23
00:00:55,641 --> 00:00:57,184
- Bacteria.
- No.

24
00:00:57,267 --> 00:00:59,061
- You like saying no.
- Yes.

25
00:01:00,646 --> 00:01:02,522
Not bacteria. Not viruses.

26
00:01:02,606 --> 00:01:04,399
- So?
- Fungus.

27
00:01:06,276 --> 00:01:08,070
Yes, that's the usual response.

28
00:01:08,153 --> 00:01:09,863
Fungi seem harmless enough.

29
00:01:09,947 --> 00:01:11,657
Many species know otherwise.

30
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,910
Because there are some fungi
who seek not to kill,

31
00:01:15,244 --> 00:01:16,453
but to control.

32
00:01:16,536 --> 00:01:19,164
Let me ask you,
where do we get LSD from?

33
00:01:19,248 --> 00:01:21,166
Where do you get it from?

34
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,460
It comes from ergot, a fungus.

35
00:01:23,543 --> 00:01:25,837
Psilocybin, also a fungus.

36
00:01:25,921 --> 00:01:29,800
Viruses can make us ill,
but fungi can alter our very minds.

37
00:01:29,883 --> 00:01:31,927
There's a fungus that infects insects.

38
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,887
Gets inside an ant, for example,

39
00:01:33,971 --> 00:01:37,182
travels through its circulatory system
to the ant's brain,

40
00:01:37,266 --> 00:01:39,142
and then floods it with hallucinogens,

41
00:01:39,226 --> 00:01:42,521
thus bending the ant's mind to its will.

42
00:01:42,604 --> 00:01:44,564
The fungus starts to direct
the ant's behavior,

43
00:01:44,648 --> 00:01:46,275
telling it where to go, what to do,

44
00:01:46,358 --> 00:01:48,402
like a puppeteer with a marionette.

45
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,945
And it gets worse.

46
00:01:50,028 --> 00:01:51,405
The fungus needs food to live,

47
00:01:51,488 --> 00:01:54,825
so it begins to devour
its host from within,

48
00:01:54,908 --> 00:01:57,411
replacing the ant's flesh with its own,

49
00:01:57,494 --> 00:01:59,329
but it doesn't let its victim die.

50
00:01:59,413 --> 00:02:04,584
No, it keeps its puppet alive
by preventing decomposition.

51
00:02:05,002 --> 00:02:08,046
- How? Where do we get penicillin from?
- Fungus.

52
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,067
Dr. Schoenheiss, you're in distress.

53
00:02:11,091 --> 00:02:14,052
Fungal infection of this kind is real,
but not in humans.

54
00:02:14,136 --> 00:02:16,054
True, fungi cannot survive

55
00:02:16,138 --> 00:02:19,891
if its host's internal temperature
is over 94 degrees.

56
00:02:19,975 --> 00:02:22,519
And currently, there are no reasons
for fungi to evolve

57
00:02:22,602 --> 00:02:24,289
to be able to withstand
higher temperatures.

58
00:02:24,313 --> 00:02:25,498
But what if that were to change?

59
00:02:25,522 --> 00:02:28,317
What if, for instance,

60
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,819
the world were to get slightly warmer?

61
00:02:31,445 --> 00:02:34,531
Well, now there is reason to evolve.

62
00:02:34,614 --> 00:02:38,869
One gene mutates and an <i>ascomycete,
candida,</i> ergot,

63
00:02:38,952 --> 00:02:41,955
<i>cordyceps, aspergillus,</i>
any one of them could become

64
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:44,082
capable of burrowing into our brains

65
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,543
and taking control,
not of millions of us,

66
00:02:46,626 --> 00:02:47,836
but billions of us.

67
00:02:48,378 --> 00:02:51,214
Billions of puppets with poisoned minds

68
00:02:51,298 --> 00:02:54,051
permanently fixed on one unifying goal:

69
00:02:54,426 --> 00:02:58,597
to spread the infection
to every last human alive

70
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,973
by any means necessary.

71
00:03:00,057 --> 00:03:01,534
And there are no treatments for this.

72
00:03:01,558 --> 00:03:04,019
No preventatives, no cures.

73
00:03:04,102 --> 00:03:06,938
They don't exist.
It's not even possible to make them.

74
00:03:08,482 --> 00:03:09,733
So, if that happens...

75
00:03:11,777 --> 00:03:12,861
We lose.

76
00:03:17,366 --> 00:03:18,450
We'll be back.

77
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,261
Alarm.

78
00:05:02,804 --> 00:05:03,930
Alarm!

79
00:05:20,447 --> 00:05:22,866
- Where's the pancake mix?
- Oh, was I...

80
00:05:23,241 --> 00:05:24,576
Yeah, I was. Sorry.

81
00:05:24,743 --> 00:05:26,411
I was gonna make you birthday pancakes.

82
00:05:26,495 --> 00:05:27,746
I swear.

83
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:29,456
You know I don't really like pancakes.

84
00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:32,083
I know you don't like them.
It was for my benefit.

85
00:05:36,213 --> 00:05:37,213
Vitamin C.

86
00:05:46,056 --> 00:05:47,766
You get your homework done?

87
00:05:50,185 --> 00:05:51,186
Fractions?

88
00:05:54,231 --> 00:05:56,441
- How old are you again?
- Thirty-six.

89
00:05:57,526 --> 00:06:00,246
- You're gonna have to wear diapers soon.
- Who says I don't already?

90
00:06:03,532 --> 00:06:04,448
Shell.

91
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:05,575
Calcium.

92
00:06:06,326 --> 00:06:07,326
Lovely.

93
00:06:09,037 --> 00:06:10,306
Is there enough for Uncle Tommy?

94
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,706
Well, there would've been.

95
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:14,583
Hey.

96
00:06:14,584 --> 00:06:15,984
You're still alive, you old fucker.

97
00:06:16,336 --> 00:06:17,629
Aw. He loves you.

98
00:06:17,712 --> 00:06:19,589
He's dependent on me. Not the same.

99
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,132
I think it's the same.

100
00:06:21,216 --> 00:06:23,552
It's definitely the same.
I thought we was having pancakes.

101
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:25,780
We'll pick you somethin' up on the road.

102
00:06:25,804 --> 00:06:28,014
- Concrete guys gonna be there?
- Yeah, they said maybe.

103
00:06:28,098 --> 00:06:31,184
Maybe? We can't frame until we pour.
We're not getting paid until we frame.

104
00:06:31,268 --> 00:06:33,454
Well, we could bring someone else on,
get the job done faster.

105
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:36,198
No, no. I'm not splitting this job.
I barely wanna split it with you.

106
00:06:36,815 --> 00:06:37,816
We could work a double.

107
00:06:38,191 --> 00:06:40,694
- Literally? Today?
- I know. I'll be done by 9:00.

108
00:06:40,777 --> 00:06:42,112
By 9:00, right?

109
00:06:42,821 --> 00:06:43,821
Yeah.

110
00:06:45,073 --> 00:06:46,241
I'll bring back a cake.

111
00:06:46,866 --> 00:06:47,866
I promise.

112
00:06:50,495 --> 00:06:52,831
...<i>continued
disturbances in Jakarta,</i>

113
00:06:52,914 --> 00:06:54,249
<i>but are advising US citizens...</i>

114
00:06:54,332 --> 00:06:56,376
Jakarta. Where is that, Middle East?

115
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:58,437
It doesn't ring a bell.
It's definitely a country.

116
00:06:58,461 --> 00:07:00,672
- Or maybe part of Asia?
- Jakarta isn't a country.

117
00:07:00,755 --> 00:07:03,425
Being a part of Asia isn't
mutually exclusive with being a country,

118
00:07:03,508 --> 00:07:05,427
and in fact,
it's the capital of Indonesia.

119
00:07:05,927 --> 00:07:08,013
Shit. Hope for us yet.

120
00:07:14,853 --> 00:07:15,853
All right.

121
00:07:16,646 --> 00:07:18,315
Finish up quick, we'll drop you off.

122
00:07:18,398 --> 00:07:20,984
- I'm still eating my eggshells.
- You got seven minutes.

123
00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:22,777
Your t-shirt's inside out.

124
00:07:26,114 --> 00:07:27,449
Shit.

125
00:07:29,993 --> 00:07:30,993
He's losing it.

126
00:08:12,243 --> 00:08:14,329
Sarah!

127
00:08:20,502 --> 00:08:21,586
Hey, neighbor!

128
00:08:22,295 --> 00:08:23,296
Oh, hi.

129
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,717
Connie was asking after you,
since you haven't been over in a while.

130
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:29,177
You make 'em happy.

131
00:08:30,595 --> 00:08:33,890
I could come by after school,
but just for, like, a little bit.

132
00:08:33,973 --> 00:08:35,266
She'll take whatcha got.

133
00:08:35,684 --> 00:08:37,894
Y'all can bake or whatever.

134
00:08:38,311 --> 00:08:39,437
Speaking of,

135
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:41,564
we got a lot of extra here.

136
00:08:41,648 --> 00:08:43,149
Y'all want some biscuits?

137
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,694
Dad, you love biscuits.

138
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,533
I do.

139
00:08:51,616 --> 00:08:52,951
But I'm on Atkins.

140
00:08:53,493 --> 00:08:56,121
- On what now?
- It's a... You know what?

141
00:08:56,204 --> 00:08:57,872
We gotta run, but Sarah'll be by later.

142
00:08:57,956 --> 00:08:59,582
She'll stay as long as you want,

143
00:09:00,417 --> 00:09:01,918
tell you all about Atkins.

144
00:09:02,001 --> 00:09:04,003
Great! I'll let Connie know.

145
00:09:04,713 --> 00:09:05,713
Solid.

146
00:09:09,134 --> 00:09:11,946
Can't tell you how exciting it was
listening to that fucking conversation.

147
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:12,971
Put that out.

148
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:15,724
Happy birthday to you.

149
00:09:26,025 --> 00:09:29,195
I want you to write this diagram out
exactly as I have it.

150
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,906
Always subject and predicate,

151
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,658
verb and noun.

152
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:37,370
Okay? The sentence is,
"Where are you going?" Subject is "You".

153
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:39,330
"You are going",

154
00:09:40,165 --> 00:09:41,624
predicate.

155
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,251
"Where", adverb.

156
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:45,879
You see it? Okay.
I have some nods, shaking of heads.

157
00:09:45,962 --> 00:09:47,922
I swear you will use this later in life.

158
00:09:48,006 --> 00:09:49,799
Believe me, that's why you're here.

159
00:09:49,883 --> 00:09:51,009
Okay? So...

160
00:09:57,515 --> 00:09:59,235
Yes, you need
to know this!

161
00:09:59,267 --> 00:10:01,227
Yes, it's on your test next week!

162
00:10:01,978 --> 00:10:05,523
Homework is due end of class tomorrow!

163
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:01,119
Twenty.

164
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:02,579
That's it?

165
00:11:02,831 --> 00:11:03,957
Okay, 30.

166
00:11:05,124 --> 00:11:06,167
Twenty's good.

167
00:11:06,251 --> 00:11:08,461
It's a spring. I'll do it right now.

168
00:11:27,897 --> 00:11:30,066
All day. I swear.

169
00:11:33,152 --> 00:11:34,152
We're closing.

170
00:11:35,989 --> 00:11:37,240
We're done for today.

171
00:11:37,323 --> 00:11:38,908
It's 3:15, we close at 7:00.

172
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,873
- I'm very sorry. He cannot finish.
- I'm already finished.

173
00:11:48,877 --> 00:11:50,169
You should go home.

174
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,649
- There you are, sweetie.
- Sorry.

175
00:12:11,733 --> 00:12:13,026
I was getting worried.

176
00:12:13,109 --> 00:12:14,903
I was getting something for my dad.

177
00:12:15,695 --> 00:12:16,738
Hi, Mercy.

178
00:12:18,948 --> 00:12:22,243
Hey, is everything okay?
Like, on the news?

179
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,703
Like what, hon?

180
00:12:24,329 --> 00:12:27,540
Well, no, there was just a lot of police
and stuff on the road today.

181
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,459
Well, that's true every day, isn't it?

182
00:12:29,876 --> 00:12:32,128
People out there need
to get right with Jesus.

183
00:12:32,211 --> 00:12:36,299
Three nails plus one cross
equals four-given.

184
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:39,427
I was thinking we'd make some cookies.

185
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,678
Chocolate chip?

186
00:12:41,262 --> 00:12:42,262
Raisin.

187
00:12:51,022 --> 00:12:53,191
Come on, Mama. It's green.

188
00:12:53,274 --> 00:12:54,754
You love that.

189
00:12:55,401 --> 00:12:56,653
Here we go!

190
00:12:58,154 --> 00:12:59,739
I don't know why I talk to her.

191
00:12:59,822 --> 00:13:01,366
She's completely deaf.

192
00:13:30,478 --> 00:13:31,562
Wanna give me a hand?

193
00:13:31,646 --> 00:13:32,855
Be right there!

194
00:13:55,128 --> 00:13:56,462
Hey, Mrs. Adler?

195
00:13:56,546 --> 00:13:58,089
Could I borrow this?

196
00:14:00,842 --> 00:14:02,385
Yeah, sure.

197
00:14:02,844 --> 00:14:04,053
It's one of Danny's.

198
00:14:05,346 --> 00:14:07,265
You know what?
My dad's gonna be back real soon.

199
00:14:07,348 --> 00:14:09,058
- I should go.
- You sure?

200
00:14:09,142 --> 00:14:11,561
- Yeah.
- Well, then you're taking some cookies.

201
00:15:00,777 --> 00:15:03,088
<i>No comment today
from the Austin Police Department</i>

202
00:15:03,112 --> 00:15:06,199
<i>regarding a rash of violent incidents
across the city,</i>

203
00:15:06,282 --> 00:15:09,535
<i>some suggesting a new street drug
may be to blame.</i>

204
00:15:09,619 --> 00:15:13,164
<i>More on that when we return,
with Manuela Sanchez reporting live...</i>

205
00:15:20,546 --> 00:15:22,048
You locked the door for once.

206
00:15:22,715 --> 00:15:24,717
- Good job.
- Yeah.

207
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:31,516
- It's 10:00.
- I know.

208
00:15:32,016 --> 00:15:35,061
They gave us the wrong size
for the headers.

209
00:15:36,479 --> 00:15:38,314
That doesn't mean anything to you.
I'm sorry.

210
00:15:39,315 --> 00:15:40,315
Where's the cake?

211
00:15:41,234 --> 00:15:43,194
- Shit.
- Come on, man.

212
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:44,557
I'll get us one tomorrow.

213
00:15:44,821 --> 00:15:47,657
Swear? Or you don't get your present.

214
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,992
- You got me a present?
- Swear.

215
00:15:50,827 --> 00:15:51,828
On my life.

216
00:15:59,544 --> 00:16:00,545
Wow.

217
00:16:04,674 --> 00:16:05,674
Fixed it for you.

218
00:16:13,349 --> 00:16:14,642
- Did you?
- What?

219
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:15,852
I don't hear anything.

220
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:18,311
That was lame.

221
00:16:18,354 --> 00:16:20,189
- You're lame.
- Yeah, I know.

222
00:16:21,691 --> 00:16:23,109
Where'd you get the money for this?

223
00:16:23,693 --> 00:16:25,528
Drugs. I sell hardcore drugs.

224
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:26,696
It's better than what I do.

225
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:29,115
It was only $20, which I stole from you.

226
00:16:30,616 --> 00:16:31,826
I could've stolen $60,

227
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:33,804
but I put the change back
because I'm an honest thief.

228
00:16:33,828 --> 00:16:35,955
- Hmm.
- Besides, it's the thought that counts.

229
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,249
And you were never gonna
do it for yourself, so.

230
00:16:43,713 --> 00:16:44,713
Thank you.

231
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,550
There's one more.

232
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:52,763
Borrowed it from the Adlers.

233
00:16:52,847 --> 00:16:54,891
Oh, this is the one
with the deleted scenes.

234
00:16:54,974 --> 00:16:57,018
Yeah, imagine how bad those have to be.

235
00:16:57,101 --> 00:16:59,187
Come on, pop it in.
While it's still your birthday.

236
00:17:08,988 --> 00:17:10,823
- Don't fall asleep.
- 'Course, I won't.

237
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:12,953
It's too riveting.

238
00:17:34,722 --> 00:17:35,638
Hello?

239
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,058
<i>Joel, it's me.</i>

240
00:17:37,141 --> 00:17:38,267
<i>I'm okay.</i>

241
00:17:39,227 --> 00:17:40,895
- Yeah?
<i>- But I'm in jail.</i>

242
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,523
- God damn it.
<i>- Wasn't my fault this time.</i>

243
00:17:44,607 --> 00:17:47,485
<i>I was at the bar, some guy goes crazy,
starts swinging at a waitress,</i>

244
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:49,368
<i>I stepped in, knocked him out,
cops show up...</i>

245
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:50,780
<i>Look, it doesn't fucking matter.</i>

246
00:17:50,863 --> 00:17:52,281
<i>- You gotta bail me out.</i>
- Now?

247
00:17:52,365 --> 00:17:53,842
<i>It's Friday,
you don't get me out tonight,</i>

248
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:54,909
<i>I'm in here all weekend.</i>

249
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:56,994
<i>It's a fucking madhouse, Joel.</i>

250
00:17:57,078 --> 00:17:59,580
<i>- I gotta get out.</i>
- Which jail? Travis County?

251
00:17:59,664 --> 00:18:00,915
<i>Yeah, on 10th.</i>

252
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:03,542
- God damn it, Tommy.
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>

253
00:18:05,628 --> 00:18:06,629
<i>Please.</i>

254
00:18:07,922 --> 00:18:08,922
Okay.

255
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,466
Fucking idiot.

256
00:19:13,321 --> 00:19:14,321
Dad?

257
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:24,622
Dad?

258
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:46,687
<i>Law enforcement
and emergency services are in the area</i>

259
00:19:46,771 --> 00:19:49,023
<i>and will be in contact
with further instructions.</i>

260
00:19:51,192 --> 00:19:53,402
<i>Stay indoors. Law enforcement...</i>

261
00:20:00,618 --> 00:20:02,328
Easy. Easy, Mercy.

262
00:20:03,496 --> 00:20:04,830
What are you doing out here, boy?

263
00:20:33,109 --> 00:20:35,029
Come on, let's get you home.

264
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,698
Come on, Mercy. Please.

265
00:20:40,825 --> 00:20:41,867
Mercy!

266
00:20:53,129 --> 00:20:54,255
Mrs. Adler?

267
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:16,318
Mrs. Adler?

268
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,391
Mrs. Adler?

269
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:03,072
Help me.

270
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:55,709
Get in the truck! Right now!

271
00:22:56,252 --> 00:22:57,628
Move!

272
00:23:09,139 --> 00:23:10,182
What are we doing, Joel?

273
00:23:26,532 --> 00:23:28,826
- You killed her.
- Baby, I'm sorry.

274
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:30,703
- Joel, we gotta go.
- Sarah, listen to me.

275
00:23:31,078 --> 00:23:32,496
It's not just the Adlers.

276
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,664
But we're gonna be brave,

277
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:35,587
and we're gonna get outta this.

278
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:37,668
Hey. Let's go. Come on.

279
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:39,670
Get in.

280
00:23:41,505 --> 00:23:42,506
Joel?

281
00:23:42,965 --> 00:23:44,717
Denise, you get back inside the house!

282
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,886
- You lock your doors! Now!
- Come on, get in!

283
00:23:57,062 --> 00:23:58,647
- Get your seat belt on.
- Hold on.

284
00:24:02,526 --> 00:24:04,153
Jesus Christ, Joel!

285
00:24:08,532 --> 00:24:10,326
- You take 71.
- 71, I know.

286
00:24:19,543 --> 00:24:20,586
- Daddy...
- We don't know.

287
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:23,088
They're saying it's a virus.
Some kind of parasite.

288
00:24:23,422 --> 00:24:24,715
Is it from terrorists?

289
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:26,884
We don't know.

290
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:29,678
- Are we sick?
- No. Of course not.

291
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:30,971
Why did things blow up?

292
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,681
No cellphone, no radio.

293
00:24:33,349 --> 00:24:34,868
A minute ago, newsman wouldn't shut up.

294
00:24:34,892 --> 00:24:36,492
- How do you know?
- What?

295
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,050
How do you know we're not sick?

296
00:24:39,104 --> 00:24:41,224
They're saying
it's mostly people in the city.

297
00:24:41,649 --> 00:24:43,400
That's why they got
the highway blocked off.

298
00:24:47,112 --> 00:24:48,112
God.

299
00:24:48,656 --> 00:24:49,740
That's Jimmy's place.

300
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:01,377
The Adlers would take Nana into the city

301
00:25:02,002 --> 00:25:03,337
to the hospital for stuff.

302
00:25:03,796 --> 00:25:06,173
That's right. They would.
That's probably why.

303
00:25:09,093 --> 00:25:12,638
But, you'd have to go a lot, right?

304
00:25:13,138 --> 00:25:14,306
We're fine. Trust me.

305
00:25:18,268 --> 00:25:19,269
All right.

306
00:25:25,025 --> 00:25:26,276
Here! Right here!

307
00:25:26,694 --> 00:25:28,153
- Hey!
- What are you doing?

308
00:25:28,237 --> 00:25:30,364
- They got a kid, Joel.
- So do we. Keep driving.

309
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:32,807
- Please, no! No, no!
- We could put them in the back.

310
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:37,830
Somebody else will come along.

311
00:25:48,966 --> 00:25:51,176
Fuck! Everybody had
the same fucking idea.

312
00:25:52,553 --> 00:25:55,431
- I can't get through this.
- All right. Let's think it through.

313
00:25:55,514 --> 00:25:56,866
- Fuck!
- All right, take the field.

314
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,767
We cut across
and we pick up on the west side.

315
00:25:58,851 --> 00:26:00,561
Yeah, yeah.
West, west, all right.

316
00:26:00,644 --> 00:26:01,645
All right, hang on.

317
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,411
Shit! Fucking Army.

318
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:19,374
- Isn't that good?
- It's good for them,

319
00:26:19,455 --> 00:26:21,415
but that's the highway
we're trying to get to.

320
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:22,809
All right, keep moving.
Head north.

321
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:24,769
- Could be a lot of people.
- Well, we can't go south,

322
00:26:24,793 --> 00:26:27,313
we can't go east, we can't go west.
Hell else we supposed to go?

323
00:26:28,922 --> 00:26:29,922
Tommy, come on!

324
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:38,056
Yeah, I know that place.

325
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,659
- This can work.
- Yeah, but then what?

326
00:26:39,683 --> 00:26:41,518
I don't know. Mexico. Just far.

327
00:26:41,602 --> 00:26:44,897
- Far as we can. How much gas?
- Three-quarter tank.

328
00:26:45,481 --> 00:26:47,801
Go through town, golf course
by the river, straight across,

329
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:50,569
we pick up the highway
on the other side of the blockade,

330
00:26:50,694 --> 00:26:51,694
then we're out.

331
00:27:00,412 --> 00:27:01,413
Maybe it's everywhere.

332
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:05,167
Maybe there's nowhere to go.

333
00:27:10,923 --> 00:27:12,341
What the fuck?

334
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,855
Son of a bitch. Gotta go around.

335
00:27:27,189 --> 00:27:28,190
Grab something!

336
00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:45,499
All right, keep going, keep going.

337
00:27:45,582 --> 00:27:46,750
Shit. Tommy!

338
00:27:51,046 --> 00:27:52,214
Tommy, you can't stop here.

339
00:27:52,881 --> 00:27:54,359
- I can't drive through 'em all.
- Are you serious?

340
00:27:54,383 --> 00:27:55,384
Just keep going!

341
00:28:00,764 --> 00:28:02,182
Go, go, go. Back, back,

342
00:28:02,266 --> 00:28:03,934
- back, back!
- I'm trying!

343
00:28:08,647 --> 00:28:10,065
Tommy, go faster! We gotta go!

344
00:28:10,148 --> 00:28:11,501
I'm trying!
There's nowhere to fucking go!

345
00:28:11,525 --> 00:28:12,794
- Find an alley!
- What alley?

346
00:28:12,818 --> 00:28:14,546
- There's people everywhere!
- Roll the fuck over them!

347
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:15,988
We gotta get off this street now!

348
00:28:16,071 --> 00:28:17,340
That's what I'm trying to do, Joel.

349
00:28:17,364 --> 00:28:19,164
We're gonna be okay.
Just keep driving.

350
00:28:19,241 --> 00:28:20,242
Dad?

351
00:28:21,285 --> 00:28:22,327
Holy shit!

352
00:28:23,328 --> 00:28:25,497
Move. Move!

353
00:28:57,738 --> 00:28:59,823
Sarah, Sarah.

354
00:28:59,907 --> 00:29:01,241
Stay right there. Don't move.

355
00:29:02,618 --> 00:29:03,952
Tommy, you okay?

356
00:29:04,036 --> 00:29:04,952
Yeah, okay.

357
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:20,719
Sarah, don't look.

358
00:29:21,428 --> 00:29:23,263
You look at me, okay?

359
00:29:23,347 --> 00:29:25,267
I'm sorry, baby, I know, I know.

360
00:29:25,307 --> 00:29:26,576
Come here. Put your arms around me.

361
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,768
Come here, come here.

362
00:29:28,644 --> 00:29:30,854
I got you. I got you.

363
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,480
Got you.

364
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:37,027
Are you okay? Are you okay?

365
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,695
- My ankle.
- All right, okay.

366
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:41,019
We gotta get off the street! Shit!

367
00:29:45,285 --> 00:29:46,285
Tommy?

368
00:29:47,162 --> 00:29:48,246
Tommy!

369
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:49,831
Tommy!

370
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:53,460
Head to the river! I'll find a way.

371
00:29:54,503 --> 00:29:55,663
Get her outta here, Joel! Go!

372
00:29:57,798 --> 00:29:59,275
- We can't leave him.
- He'll be fine.

373
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:00,509
- Can you run?
- No.

374
00:30:02,219 --> 00:30:03,579
- You keep your eyes on me.
- Okay.

375
00:30:03,637 --> 00:30:04,553
- Okay?
- Okay.

376
00:30:04,554 --> 00:30:05,764
And don't look anywhere else.

377
00:30:06,473 --> 00:30:07,473
All right.

378
00:31:05,866 --> 00:31:07,743
It's okay, baby. You're safe.

379
00:31:08,452 --> 00:31:09,453
Don't move!

380
00:31:11,455 --> 00:31:14,041
- My daughter's hurt her ankle.
- Stop right there!

381
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:16,543
Okay.

382
00:31:17,294 --> 00:31:19,713
Easy now. We're not sick!

383
00:31:20,297 --> 00:31:22,966
I've got two civilians by the river,
one of them injured.

384
00:31:24,509 --> 00:31:25,510
Ankle.

385
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:27,846
What about Uncle Tommy?

386
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,223
We're gonna get you
somewhere safe first.

387
00:31:30,307 --> 00:31:31,987
- Then we'll go back for him, okay?
- Okay.

388
00:31:32,225 --> 00:31:33,727
- Okay.
- I'm sorry, repeat?

389
00:31:33,935 --> 00:31:35,729
Hey. No one told you to move.

390
00:31:37,773 --> 00:31:38,773
Yes, sir.

391
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:41,967
Yes, sir.

392
00:31:44,654 --> 00:31:45,697
Yes, sir.

393
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:51,536
We're not sick.

394
00:31:54,372 --> 00:31:55,457
Sir,

395
00:31:56,291 --> 00:31:58,001
we are not sick!

396
00:32:11,014 --> 00:32:12,014
I'm sorry.

397
00:32:13,475 --> 00:32:14,643
Please, don't.

398
00:32:24,486 --> 00:32:25,737
Oh, God.

399
00:32:31,326 --> 00:32:32,494
No.

400
00:32:32,786 --> 00:32:34,621
No, no. No.

401
00:32:35,747 --> 00:32:37,582
Okay. You're okay.

402
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:39,960
You're okay. Move your hand, baby.

403
00:32:40,043 --> 00:32:41,086
Move your hand.

404
00:32:47,801 --> 00:32:49,886
I know, baby, I know,
I know, I know, I know.

405
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:51,096
I know it hurts.

406
00:32:51,847 --> 00:32:54,349
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

407
00:32:54,432 --> 00:32:57,018
Come on, baby. You're okay, you're okay.

408
00:32:57,561 --> 00:33:00,939
I know, I know, I know, I know, baby,
I know, I know. I know this hurts.

409
00:33:01,606 --> 00:33:02,774
You're gonna be okay.

410
00:33:02,858 --> 00:33:06,528
All right. Baby, baby, listen to me.

411
00:33:06,611 --> 00:33:08,613
I gotta get you up, okay?

412
00:33:08,697 --> 00:33:09,697
I gotta get you up.

413
00:33:10,198 --> 00:33:12,117
All right? Come on.

414
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,077
You come on. I know, baby.

415
00:33:14,411 --> 00:33:16,997
No, no. I know, I know, I know,
I know, I know, I know.

416
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,080
Tommy, help me!

417
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:20,584
Joel.

418
00:33:22,002 --> 00:33:23,086
Come on, baby girl.

419
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:24,963
Come on, baby girl. I gotta get you up.

420
00:33:25,046 --> 00:33:26,173
Come on.

421
00:33:26,256 --> 00:33:27,382
Come on, we'll get up.

422
00:33:27,465 --> 00:33:29,785
Come on, baby girl.

423
00:33:30,218 --> 00:33:32,929
Come on, come on, please.

424
00:36:18,428 --> 00:36:20,108
We don't want you
falling out of the chair.

425
00:36:21,222 --> 00:36:22,265
What's your name?

426
00:36:24,517 --> 00:36:25,810
Are you alone?

427
00:36:31,941 --> 00:36:33,193
And...

428
00:36:34,235 --> 00:36:35,904
how did you get this?

429
00:36:39,449 --> 00:36:42,160
It's gonna be
a little tickle right here.

430
00:36:51,753 --> 00:36:54,172
What if I told you
that after we gave you some medicine,

431
00:36:54,714 --> 00:36:56,591
we're gonna find you
your favorite food to eat?

432
00:36:57,133 --> 00:36:58,218
Would you like that?

433
00:36:59,386 --> 00:37:02,222
And then we'll get you
some new clothes and toys,

434
00:37:02,972 --> 00:37:04,682
as many as you wanna play with.

435
00:37:09,521 --> 00:37:10,939
It's just a little needle.

436
00:37:12,774 --> 00:37:14,109
It's okay.

437
00:37:18,947 --> 00:37:19,989
You're safe.

438
00:38:24,804 --> 00:38:25,804
I can't.

439
00:39:05,803 --> 00:39:06,803
Ten.

440
00:39:17,815 --> 00:39:20,652
- You got anything else?
- Nothing today.

441
00:39:20,735 --> 00:39:24,864
Tomorrow, we got street sweeping,
or sewer maintenance.

442
00:39:25,365 --> 00:39:26,533
Which pays more?

443
00:39:27,116 --> 00:39:28,618
That'd be the one with the shit.

444
00:39:33,456 --> 00:39:34,874
Late crew. 4:00 p.m. start.

445
00:40:11,869 --> 00:40:15,206
...<i>violation
of EMC 342.3,</i>

446
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:17,709

453
00:40:55,538 --> 00:40:56,538
Come on.

454
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:05,715
- Or I could just shoot you.
- Yeah, but then what would you do?

455
00:41:07,759 --> 00:41:09,010
You're short five.

456
00:41:29,614 --> 00:41:31,407
- Oxy?
- Hydro.

457
00:41:32,408 --> 00:41:33,785
- How old?
- Three months.

458
00:41:33,868 --> 00:41:35,763
- From Atlanta?
- I don't know where he gets 'em from.

459
00:41:35,787 --> 00:41:38,227
- I just know they're real.
- If it's real, it's from Atlanta.

460
00:41:38,498 --> 00:41:40,541
FEDRA's got a factory
down there in the QZ.

461
00:41:40,625 --> 00:41:42,877
Supposedly only makes two things.

462
00:41:44,671 --> 00:41:46,714
Pills and bullets, bullets and pills.

463
00:41:46,798 --> 00:41:49,151
Well, the more you shoot people,
the harder it is to sleep, I guess.

464
00:41:49,175 --> 00:41:51,219
Oh, you guess?

465
00:41:52,512 --> 00:41:53,513
You want 'em or not?

466
00:41:58,935 --> 00:42:00,478
I need the bag back.

467
00:42:05,191 --> 00:42:07,031
- How are we doing with the vehicle?
- All set.

468
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,986
Had to get one last guy in the depot
to buy in.

469
00:42:09,696 --> 00:42:10,863
Okay, how much?

470
00:42:10,947 --> 00:42:14,325
Four of them on that shift plus me,
600 total.

471
00:42:15,576 --> 00:42:18,079
Look, those trucks are shitheaped
for a reason.

472
00:42:18,162 --> 00:42:20,206
And they don't have
any batteries. I know.

473
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:23,584
I can see about 200 for the other guys,
200 for you.

474
00:42:26,045 --> 00:42:27,045
Deal.

475
00:42:28,589 --> 00:42:30,508
Hey. Do yourself a favor,

476
00:42:31,467 --> 00:42:33,227
stay off the streets
for the next few nights.

477
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,847
Fucking Fireflies been
blowing shit up all week.

478
00:42:36,389 --> 00:42:37,866
Two of our guys got shot this morning.

479
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:41,144
Boss has got us working doubles.
Guys are jumpy and tired.

480
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,188
It's easy to make a mistake in the dark.

481
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,526
Stay safe.

482
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:50,653
Yeah, you too.

483
00:43:11,716 --> 00:43:13,396
What do you want me
to say, Tess?

484
00:43:14,177 --> 00:43:16,304
I'm not asking you
to say anything.

485
00:43:18,181 --> 00:43:19,223
Sure.

486
00:43:22,435 --> 00:43:26,898
It's not like I planned
on ripping you off.

487
00:43:27,565 --> 00:43:28,565
I'm sorry.

488
00:43:29,901 --> 00:43:30,943
Well...

489
00:43:32,987 --> 00:43:35,031
how about we just let it go?

490
00:43:42,622 --> 00:43:44,540
What else are you gonna do?

491
00:43:44,624 --> 00:43:45,625
You gonna keep me here?

492
00:43:46,042 --> 00:43:48,211
- Kill me?
- Tess, come on.

493
00:43:48,294 --> 00:43:50,421
Then, Robert, what do you want?

494
00:43:50,505 --> 00:43:51,899
I want you to forget this ever happened.

495
00:43:51,923 --> 00:43:52,965
Done.

496
00:43:53,424 --> 00:43:54,634
- Don't do that.
- What?

497
00:43:54,717 --> 00:43:56,177
It's just a truck battery.

498
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:59,263
I paid you for it, you sold it
to someone else, and you spent my money.

499
00:43:59,347 --> 00:44:00,741
You think I've
never done shit like that?

500
00:44:00,765 --> 00:44:03,267
- My guys fucked you up.
- Yeah, so discipline them.

501
00:44:03,351 --> 00:44:05,520
Cut off a finger
or whatever the fuck you want.

502
00:44:05,603 --> 00:44:07,203
I don't care. They're your fucking guys.

503
00:44:08,147 --> 00:44:09,398
What about your guy?

504
00:44:10,024 --> 00:44:12,211
'Cause when he sees you,
I mean... put yourself in my shoes.

505
00:44:12,235 --> 00:44:13,820
Look, he answers to me.

506
00:44:14,612 --> 00:44:17,406
So, I give you my word
that he won't hurt you.

507
00:44:18,157 --> 00:44:21,828
I'll tell him
that I got jumped by some guys,

508
00:44:21,911 --> 00:44:24,789
and then you
and I can just move the fuck on.

509
00:44:27,416 --> 00:44:30,711
Now your shit has
pretty much ruined my week,

510
00:44:30,795 --> 00:44:34,882
and I'd like to go home
and drink 'til my face stops hurting.

511
00:44:34,966 --> 00:44:36,342
So, are we good?

512
00:44:42,598 --> 00:44:43,598
Yeah.

513
00:44:57,238 --> 00:44:58,948

00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:04,931
They're shooting.

529
00:46:05,014 --> 00:46:07,117
- They're shooting at us.
- On your knees. On your knees.

530
00:46:07,141 --> 00:46:08,392
No, no! I'm not a F...

531
00:46:12,146 --> 00:46:14,482
I'm not a Firefly!

532
00:46:45,346 --> 00:46:47,014
Count slowly and clearly
from one to ten.

533
00:46:47,098 --> 00:46:49,809
- One, two, three, four...
- Slowly, and clearly.

534
00:46:51,602 --> 00:46:52,602
One.

535
00:46:53,312 --> 00:46:54,312
Two.

536
00:46:54,689 --> 00:46:55,689
Three.

537
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:57,440
Four.

538
00:46:58,025 --> 00:46:59,025
Five.

539
00:46:59,235 --> 00:47:00,236
Six.

540
00:47:00,695 --> 00:47:01,695
Seven.

541
00:47:02,279 --> 00:47:03,322
Eight.

542
00:47:03,406 --> 00:47:04,824
Fuck

543
00:47:04,907 --> 00:47:06,075
you.

544
00:47:08,369 --> 00:47:09,578
And hold out your...

545
00:47:11,455 --> 00:47:13,833
- State your name, slowly and clearly.
- Veronica.

546
00:47:14,542 --> 00:47:19,964
Same as yesterday, and the day before,
and the day before, and the...

547
00:47:20,464 --> 00:47:22,104
Hey.
People are gonna come looking for me.

548
00:47:22,425 --> 00:47:24,010
People from FEDRA, you hear me?

549
00:47:24,093 --> 00:47:26,429
Let me out
or you're gonna pay, motherfuckers!

550
00:47:28,889 --> 00:47:31,225
I'm not supposed to be here!

551
00:48:05,426 --> 00:48:06,466
Hey, there's a line.

552
00:48:06,927 --> 00:48:08,679
"Tell Dad it's a girl.

553
00:48:09,305 --> 00:48:11,515
That would be good, right?

554
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:13,642
He wanted a granddaughter.

555
00:48:13,726 --> 00:48:15,019
Love, Becca."

556
00:48:15,644 --> 00:48:16,854
End message. Read back.

557
00:48:21,901 --> 00:48:22,901
Correct.

558
00:48:22,902 --> 00:48:24,112
73-K Orlando, out.

559
00:48:42,963 --> 00:48:44,006
Nothing?

560
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:47,944
Is there any chance
it's coming in at night?

561
00:48:47,968 --> 00:48:49,261
You're asleep and you miss it?

562
00:48:54,642 --> 00:48:58,145
When I'm sleeping, Gabriela listens
or my son, the smart one,

563
00:48:58,229 --> 00:48:59,730
not the other one, God bless him.

564
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,109
If Tommy responded, we'd know.

565
00:49:03,776 --> 00:49:05,653
- And you're talking to the tower?
- Every day.

566
00:49:05,736 --> 00:49:06,694
They gave him your message.

567
00:49:06,695 --> 00:49:08,365
They haven't seen
or heard from him since.

568
00:49:08,447 --> 00:49:09,447
And that's it.

569
00:49:10,407 --> 00:49:12,618
- It hasn't been that long.
- It's been three weeks.

570
00:49:12,993 --> 00:49:14,873
It's never taken him
more than a day to respond.

571
00:49:16,747 --> 00:49:17,915
I'm sure he's okay.

572
00:49:23,879 --> 00:49:25,089
Show me where the tower is.

573
00:49:26,715 --> 00:49:27,967
You can't be serious.

574
00:49:29,593 --> 00:49:31,595
Joel, it's in Wyoming.

575
00:49:32,763 --> 00:49:34,348
All this open country?

576
00:49:35,349 --> 00:49:36,475
You're a capable guy,

577
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:38,894
but there are worse things
than Infected out there.

578
00:49:38,978 --> 00:49:40,729
I hear everything on this.

579
00:49:40,813 --> 00:49:42,731
There are raiders, there are slavers...

580
00:49:42,815 --> 00:49:44,733
But you're "sure" Tommy is okay?

581
00:49:52,032 --> 00:49:53,159
It's...

582
00:49:53,242 --> 00:49:54,743
It's the Cody Tower.

583
00:49:55,911 --> 00:49:58,706
Q-Bar 4,
but I don't know exactly where...

584
00:50:04,628 --> 00:50:05,628
Next!

585
00:51:51,318 --> 00:51:52,318
<i>Joel!</i>

586
00:52:50,419 --> 00:52:52,504
I got jumped by a couple guys.

587
00:52:52,838 --> 00:52:55,090
- What guys?
- Just a couple teenagers.

588
00:52:55,174 --> 00:52:57,176
Said some shit
I probably shouldn't have.

589
00:52:59,094 --> 00:53:01,472
Come on. You know these guys
were born after the outbreak.

590
00:53:01,555 --> 00:53:03,849
Never learned how to argue.
They just start swinging.

591
00:53:03,932 --> 00:53:05,976
Fucking 19-year-old pieces of shit.

592
00:53:07,311 --> 00:53:08,520
It's a miracle you're alive.

593
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:11,523
It's a miracle any of us are alive.

594
00:53:14,026 --> 00:53:15,026
These aren't new.

595
00:53:15,861 --> 00:53:16,861
No.

596
00:53:17,821 --> 00:53:20,449
I was in FEDRA lockup all day.

597
00:53:21,867 --> 00:53:22,907
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

598
00:53:24,495 --> 00:53:26,497
- I need you to take a breath.
- What?

599
00:53:29,249 --> 00:53:30,334
- Joel.
- What?

600
00:53:32,461 --> 00:53:34,630
The guys who jumped me were with Robert.

601
00:53:35,089 --> 00:53:36,757
He sold our battery to someone else.

602
00:53:38,384 --> 00:53:39,510
Nothing's lost.

603
00:53:39,593 --> 00:53:41,428
Shit like this is gonna happen.

604
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,222
Now we just shake it off,

605
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:45,891
and we go get our cards back
or the battery.

606
00:53:45,974 --> 00:53:47,601
I need the battery, Tess.

607
00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:49,686
The truck's no good without one

608
00:53:49,770 --> 00:53:51,873
and if I don't get to Tommy soon,
he's gonna die out there!

609
00:53:51,897 --> 00:53:54,566
Okay, fuck it. We get our money back
and the battery.

610
00:53:54,650 --> 00:53:55,818
But, Joel, listen.

611
00:53:56,193 --> 00:53:57,986
Robert is terrified of you.

612
00:53:58,070 --> 00:53:59,830
So, you march out of here
all Clint Eastwood,

613
00:53:59,863 --> 00:54:01,615
he's going to get wind of it and skip.

614
00:54:01,698 --> 00:54:03,992
I need you to take a breath.

615
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:10,916
Who'd he sell it to?

616
00:54:10,999 --> 00:54:12,584
- Don't know.
- Well, where is he?

617
00:54:12,668 --> 00:54:13,669
Don't know...

618
00:54:14,378 --> 00:54:15,378
...yet.

619
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:19,049
But we're gonna find out quietly.

620
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:20,550
Understand?

621
00:54:22,052 --> 00:54:24,471
Now, I promised Robert
that you wouldn't hurt him.

622
00:54:25,597 --> 00:54:27,766
But I would very much like for you
to hurt him.

623
00:54:28,934 --> 00:54:31,228
So, let's go hunt that motherfucker down

624
00:54:31,895 --> 00:54:33,939
and get our battery and our truck.

625
00:54:34,565 --> 00:54:35,983
And then we'll go find Tommy.

626
00:54:36,942 --> 00:54:37,942
All right?

627
00:54:41,029 --> 00:54:42,029
All right.

628
00:55:05,637 --> 00:55:07,014
The team in place at Southeast 3?

629
00:55:08,765 --> 00:55:09,766
I held them back.

630
00:55:11,101 --> 00:55:12,186
I have some questions.

631
00:55:13,896 --> 00:55:14,896
Okay.

632
00:55:15,898 --> 00:55:17,978
We've been blowing up
meaningless FEDRA targets

633
00:55:18,025 --> 00:55:20,319
spread out all over the QZ
for two weeks.

634
00:55:20,402 --> 00:55:22,404
We've already lost four people,
and we're...

635
00:55:23,655 --> 00:55:24,656
What's the point of this?

636
00:55:26,283 --> 00:55:27,326
Is that your question?

637
00:55:28,076 --> 00:55:29,119
That's one of them.

638
00:55:29,786 --> 00:55:31,306
My answer is to follow fucking orders.

639
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,200
And why do you have
some random girl locked in a room?

640
00:55:34,374 --> 00:55:36,752
And the guys you have guarding her
won't tell me shit.

641
00:55:36,835 --> 00:55:40,672
Our people are asking what's going on,
and I don't know what to tell them.

642
00:55:40,756 --> 00:55:42,424
Tell them to follow fucking orders.

643
00:55:42,841 --> 00:55:44,259
You two, go to Southeast 3. Now.

644
00:55:51,225 --> 00:55:53,018
- Kim.
- Marlene.

645
00:55:53,101 --> 00:55:55,729
We are in a war
against a military dictatorship

646
00:55:55,812 --> 00:55:58,607
to restore democracy and freedom.
Does that sound about right?

647
00:55:58,690 --> 00:55:59,900
- Yes.
- Are we winning?

648
00:55:59,983 --> 00:56:00,983
Are we beating FEDRA here?

649
00:56:00,984 --> 00:56:02,546
Are the Fireflies beating
FEDRA anywhere?

650
00:56:02,569 --> 00:56:03,737
Rebellion takes time.

651
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:06,260
If you fight 20 years and get nowhere,
you're not a rebellion.

652
00:56:06,657 --> 00:56:07,908
Just spray paint.

653
00:56:09,451 --> 00:56:11,537
We're not hitting FEDRA all over the QZ.

654
00:56:11,995 --> 00:56:15,541
We hit 'em here, here, here, here, here.

655
00:56:16,375 --> 00:56:17,459
Where are we right now?

656
00:56:19,545 --> 00:56:21,213
I want FEDRA everywhere but here.

657
00:56:22,005 --> 00:56:23,549
I want them as distracted as possible.

658
00:56:23,632 --> 00:56:27,135
Because tonight, every Firefly in Boston
is gonna gather in this building,

659
00:56:27,219 --> 00:56:29,429
and we are gonna leave
the QZ. Permanently.

660
00:56:30,722 --> 00:56:31,722
We're quitting?

661
00:56:31,723 --> 00:56:35,519
No, we're taking that random girl
locked in that room west.

662
00:56:37,604 --> 00:56:39,606
From our guy
in the radio tower in Salem.

663
00:56:48,365 --> 00:56:49,365
Is this real?

664
00:56:50,534 --> 00:56:51,577
I believe it is.

665
00:56:55,539 --> 00:56:56,539
Keep it quiet.

666
00:57:00,043 --> 00:57:01,043
Whatever you need.

667
00:57:01,878 --> 00:57:02,878
Whatever it takes.

668
00:57:03,422 --> 00:57:04,923
We'll get her where she needs to go.

669
00:57:34,494 --> 00:57:35,495
Hey, friend.

670
00:57:37,706 --> 00:57:39,106
Don't worry. I don't want anything.

671
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,376
But if you're feeling lost...

672
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:43,962
You tell me to "Look for the light"
and I'll break your jaw.

673
00:57:54,556 --> 00:57:57,809
Well, I mean, it'd cost us
a couple of cards, but we got him.

674
00:57:58,685 --> 00:58:01,897
He's supposedly taking the battery
to a red-tagged building.

675
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:05,108
But get this,
the corner of Stillman and Cross.

676
00:58:05,609 --> 00:58:08,570
- The one Miguel used to use?
- Yeah, I'm thinking so.

677
00:58:08,654 --> 00:58:10,774
I mean, we can take the subway tunnel
under Haymarket,

678
00:58:10,822 --> 00:58:13,867
get into the building from below
and take Robert by surprise.

679
00:58:14,451 --> 00:58:15,744
Pay this fucker back.

680
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:25,128
Come on.

681
00:58:30,634 --> 00:58:32,511
You fucker!

682
00:58:39,142 --> 00:58:41,061
One, two, three, four...

683
00:59:09,464 --> 00:59:10,632
You're not scared?

684
00:59:13,677 --> 00:59:14,886
Then unlock me.

685
00:59:15,554 --> 00:59:17,097
How about we start with "Thank you"?

686
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:18,390
For what?

687
00:59:18,473 --> 00:59:19,725
For saving your life.

688
00:59:20,267 --> 00:59:22,602
I am the one who told them
not to shoot you, if you recall.

689
00:59:31,111 --> 00:59:32,154
Why did you stop them?

690
00:59:33,363 --> 00:59:34,363
We'll get to that.

691
00:59:48,754 --> 00:59:50,881
So, Veronica...

692
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:54,300
how you feeling?

693
00:59:56,386 --> 00:59:57,386
The same.

694
00:59:59,639 --> 01:00:00,682
Is it gonna happen?

695
01:00:03,435 --> 01:00:04,435
No.

696
01:00:07,689 --> 01:00:08,815
So, can I go?

697
01:00:09,816 --> 01:00:10,859
No.

698
01:00:10,942 --> 01:00:13,612
I won't tell anyone
about any of this, I swear.

699
01:00:14,029 --> 01:00:15,071
Where you gonna go?

700
01:00:15,155 --> 01:00:18,074
Back to FEDRA military school?
You that anxious to be a soldier?

701
01:00:18,158 --> 01:00:19,534
You think I chose that place?

702
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,828
They put me there when I was a baby.

703
01:00:21,912 --> 01:00:23,205
It's for orphans.

704
01:00:23,288 --> 01:00:24,790
"They" didn't put you there.

705
01:00:27,042 --> 01:00:28,042
I did.

706
01:00:29,002 --> 01:00:30,045
Ellie.

707
01:00:33,965 --> 01:00:35,509
You my fucking mom or something?

708
01:00:36,176 --> 01:00:37,511
Do I look like your mom?

709
01:00:38,678 --> 01:00:40,639
No, you do not.

710
01:00:41,848 --> 01:00:42,974
My name is Marlene.

711
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:45,685
I'm the leader of the Fireflies
in the Boston QZ.

712
01:00:47,312 --> 01:00:49,022
Why would a terrorist dump me
with FEDRA?

713
01:00:49,105 --> 01:00:50,500
Because it's where you'd be safest.

714
01:00:50,524 --> 01:00:52,585
And you were safe there
until you decided to sneak out.

715
01:00:52,609 --> 01:00:53,860
And "terrorist?"

716
01:00:54,945 --> 01:00:56,071
Was Riley a terrorist?

717
01:01:13,088 --> 01:01:14,798
Why won't you let me go home?

718
01:01:18,927 --> 01:01:22,055
Because you have a greater purpose
than any of us could have ever imagined.

719
01:01:23,306 --> 01:01:26,434
So, we're leaving tonight,
and we're taking you with us.

720
01:01:29,312 --> 01:01:30,772
- He's here.
- Five minutes.

721
01:01:35,986 --> 01:01:38,488
What I'm about to tell you
cannot be repeated to anyone.

722
01:01:39,197 --> 01:01:40,365
Because if you do,

723
01:01:41,116 --> 01:01:42,367
I assure you...

724
01:01:44,035 --> 01:01:45,161
you will die.

725
01:02:07,851 --> 01:02:09,019
Okay.

726
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:11,020
Ready?

727
01:02:11,438 --> 01:02:12,439
Yeah.

728
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:31,082
That's the one.

729
01:02:57,567 --> 01:02:58,610
Oh, shit!

730
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:01,820
This one's done.

731
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:05,240
Yeah.

732
01:03:06,034 --> 01:03:08,286
I know, I just... I wasn't expecting it.

733
01:03:08,787 --> 01:03:10,547
Take it he wasn't down here
last time?

734
01:03:11,623 --> 01:03:12,623
No.

735
01:03:15,251 --> 01:03:17,087
You think he came down
after he was infected?

736
01:03:18,964 --> 01:03:21,341
Or maybe down here
is where he was infected.

737
01:03:26,429 --> 01:03:27,429
Let's keep moving.

738
01:03:42,153 --> 01:03:44,239
It's like they reframed
the whole structure.

739
01:03:44,698 --> 01:03:46,032
Probably in the '80s.

740
01:03:46,116 --> 01:03:47,993
Everyone was cutting down
on apartment sizes

741
01:03:48,076 --> 01:03:49,285
to sell more condos.

742
01:03:49,369 --> 01:03:54,499
Oh. "This has been
<i>Construction Corner</i> with Joel Miller."

743
01:03:54,582 --> 01:03:55,750
How far up are we going?

744
01:03:55,834 --> 01:03:57,085
Uh,

745
01:03:58,461 --> 01:03:59,587
this far.

746
01:04:02,382 --> 01:04:06,094
So, this opens into the hallway.

747
01:04:07,303 --> 01:04:10,181
What the fuck?
Someone put a piano in front of this?

748
01:04:13,268 --> 01:04:14,352
You smell that?

749
01:04:16,521 --> 01:04:18,356
Yeah, gunpowder.

750
01:04:24,654 --> 01:04:25,697
Tess.

751
01:04:47,552 --> 01:04:48,845
Well, the battery's no good.

752
01:04:49,679 --> 01:04:51,306
And he still tried to sell it.

753
01:04:52,390 --> 01:04:53,433
Twice.

754
01:04:54,184 --> 01:04:55,769
You greedy fuck.

755
01:05:06,112 --> 01:05:07,697
Just fucking help me up.

756
01:05:09,532 --> 01:05:11,326
Shit.

757
01:05:12,243 --> 01:05:13,201
God.

758
01:05:13,203 --> 01:05:14,621
Just... Okay.

759
01:05:15,538 --> 01:05:17,707
Shit, come on.

760
01:05:24,923 --> 01:05:25,924
Fuck.

761
01:05:28,510 --> 01:05:29,594
Joel?

762
01:05:30,887 --> 01:05:33,181
Marlene?

763
01:05:33,807 --> 01:05:34,723
You okay?

764
01:05:34,724 --> 01:05:35,810
Yeah.

765
01:05:38,353 --> 01:05:39,354
Ellie.

766
01:05:39,854 --> 01:05:40,939
Ellie!

767
01:05:43,441 --> 01:05:44,357
Oh, shit!

768
01:05:44,359 --> 01:05:46,039
No, it's okay.
I'll be all right.

769
01:05:46,361 --> 01:05:48,363
And you can't be stupid like this.

770
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:52,283
So this is who Robert screwed us
over with?

771
01:05:52,367 --> 01:05:54,244
The Che Guevara of Boston?

772
01:05:54,327 --> 01:05:56,013
I mean, war must be going
pretty shitty for you

773
01:05:56,037 --> 01:05:57,580
to be buying from scumbags like him.

774
01:05:57,664 --> 01:05:58,915
Yeah, it kinda has been.

775
01:05:58,998 --> 01:06:00,333
The merch was bad,

776
01:06:00,542 --> 01:06:02,269
and he obviously didn't take
"fuck off" for an answer.

777
01:06:02,293 --> 01:06:04,533
- Give me my knife.
- What do you need a car battery for?

778
01:06:05,255 --> 01:06:06,506
- Don't.
- Not at her.

779
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:09,800
Point it at me.

780
01:06:23,523 --> 01:06:25,793
And to answer your question, I need it
for a better reason than you do.

781
01:06:25,817 --> 01:06:27,694
No offense, but Tommy's just one man.

782
01:06:28,862 --> 01:06:31,072
- It's our business to know things.
- "To know things."

783
01:06:31,865 --> 01:06:34,218
You're the cause of it.
You turned my own brother against me.

784
01:06:34,242 --> 01:06:35,719
- Okay, Joel.
- That was a lot of gunfire.

785
01:06:35,743 --> 01:06:37,453
- FEDRA's gonna be on the way.
- I know.

786
01:06:42,876 --> 01:06:44,796
We were gonna move Ellie
out of the zone tonight.

787
01:06:45,170 --> 01:06:47,839
But we won't make it anywhere like this.
Not for a while anyway.

788
01:06:47,922 --> 01:06:49,507
So now I'm thinking...

789
01:06:50,717 --> 01:06:51,633
you're gonna do it.

790
01:06:51,634 --> 01:06:52,696
- The hell we are.
- I'm not going with them!

791
01:06:52,719 --> 01:06:54,864
- Let me take her.
- Tess, we don't have time for this.

792
01:06:54,888 --> 01:06:56,448
- Oh, you don't have time?
- Who is she?

793
01:06:56,472 --> 01:06:58,325
- To you? She's cargo.
- We don't smuggle people.

794
01:06:58,349 --> 01:06:59,475
- Sorry.
- I can do it.

795
01:06:59,559 --> 01:07:01,579
Kim, you don't have a fucking ear
on your fucking head.

796
01:07:01,603 --> 01:07:02,603
Could you please?

797
01:07:04,189 --> 01:07:06,858
There's a team of Fireflies waiting
for her at the old Statehouse.

798
01:07:07,358 --> 01:07:08,651
I know what's out there.

799
01:07:08,735 --> 01:07:11,696
We were going with an entire squadron
for that very reason.

800
01:07:11,779 --> 01:07:13,591
But now I don't have a truck,
I don't have a squadron,

801
01:07:13,615 --> 01:07:16,367
FEDRA's five minutes away.
What I do have is you.

802
01:07:17,327 --> 01:07:18,995
And I know what you're both capable of.

803
01:07:19,704 --> 01:07:21,122
For better or worse.

804
01:07:24,083 --> 01:07:25,543
What are they capable of?

805
01:07:25,627 --> 01:07:28,421
You get her there safely,
and they'll give you what you need.

806
01:07:28,504 --> 01:07:30,340
Not just a battery. The whole thing.

807
01:07:30,423 --> 01:07:32,759
Fueled up truck, guns,
supplies, all of it.

808
01:07:33,176 --> 01:07:34,176
I swear.

809
01:07:37,305 --> 01:07:38,389
I swear.

810
01:07:46,397 --> 01:07:47,482
Asshole!

811
01:07:53,404 --> 01:07:54,405
You trust her?

812
01:07:55,114 --> 01:07:57,033
No, me neither, but she seems desperate.

813
01:07:57,116 --> 01:07:59,702
Firefly vehicle usually means
repurposed FEDRA stuff.

814
01:07:59,786 --> 01:08:02,223
So better than a decent chance
of making it to Tommy in one of those.

815
01:08:02,247 --> 01:08:04,642
- The second we hand that kid over...
- Y'all talk it through,

816
01:08:04,666 --> 01:08:06,459
but please remember
that I'm bleeding out.

817
01:08:10,922 --> 01:08:12,340
Okay. Here's the deal.

818
01:08:13,466 --> 01:08:15,226
We'll get her to your crew
at the Statehouse.

819
01:08:15,593 --> 01:08:18,638
But before we hand her over,
they give us everything that we want.

820
01:08:18,721 --> 01:08:20,515
If not, we kill her. There and then.

821
01:08:20,598 --> 01:08:22,725
- Deal.
- Really? That fast?

822
01:08:23,184 --> 01:08:25,937
You are all that matters.
My team will not jeopardize that.

823
01:08:26,437 --> 01:08:27,605
Remember what I told you?

824
01:08:28,064 --> 01:08:29,065
Now go get your backpack.

825
01:08:30,525 --> 01:08:32,151
Now, Ellie.

826
01:08:42,537 --> 01:08:43,579
Let's go.

827
01:08:51,462 --> 01:08:52,463
Joel.

828
01:08:54,966 --> 01:08:56,009
Don't fuck this up.

829
01:08:58,803 --> 01:08:59,803
Please.

830
01:09:51,272 --> 01:09:52,440
Give us a minute, all right?

831
01:09:52,899 --> 01:09:54,108
What the fuck...

832
01:09:55,777 --> 01:09:56,944
So, what's the plan?

833
01:09:58,654 --> 01:10:00,094
There's not a lot of options.

834
01:10:00,448 --> 01:10:02,241
There's the short way
or the long way.

835
01:10:02,575 --> 01:10:03,826
The short way is pretty much...

836
01:10:04,869 --> 01:10:06,149
That leaves the long way.

837
01:10:06,829 --> 01:10:08,748
Things look bad,
we'll come up with something.

838
01:10:08,831 --> 01:10:10,625
We have to drop,
head to Bill and Frank's.

839
01:10:10,958 --> 01:10:12,668
Stock up on anything we may need.

840
01:10:28,643 --> 01:10:31,729
We leave after dark.
Stay with the kid.

841
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:34,000
Wait. Why do I have to... Tess!

842
01:10:44,575 --> 01:10:46,119
So, who's Bill and Frank?

843
01:10:49,747 --> 01:10:51,207
The radio's a smuggling code, right?

844
01:10:51,833 --> 01:10:53,433
60's song, they don't have anything new.

845
01:10:53,501 --> 01:10:54,836
70's, they got new stuff.

846
01:10:54,919 --> 01:10:56,087
What's 80's?

847
01:11:03,136 --> 01:11:05,346
- What are you doing?
- Killing time.

848
01:11:05,430 --> 01:11:07,870
- What am I supposed to do?
- I'm sure you'll figure that out.

849
01:11:15,857 --> 01:11:16,941
Your watch is broken.

850
01:11:32,748 --> 01:11:34,125
You mumble in your sleep.

851
01:11:42,216 --> 01:11:44,093
I've never been on the other side
of the wall.

852
01:11:45,761 --> 01:11:46,971
Look how dark it is.

853
01:11:54,353 --> 01:11:55,646
You guys go out there a lot?

854
01:11:57,106 --> 01:11:58,983
- I guess.
- When was the last time?

855
01:11:59,567 --> 01:12:00,818
Maybe a year. What's it matter?

856
01:12:00,902 --> 01:12:02,222
But you know where to go.

857
01:12:03,696 --> 01:12:04,947
So we're gonna be okay.

858
01:12:09,994 --> 01:12:10,994
Yeah.

859
01:12:18,503 --> 01:12:19,730
So what's the deal with you anyway?

860
01:12:19,754 --> 01:12:21,554
You some kinda bigwig's daughter
or something?

861
01:12:23,841 --> 01:12:25,009
Something like that.

862
01:12:34,852 --> 01:12:36,479
The radio came on
when you were sleeping.

863
01:12:37,021 --> 01:12:39,357
What? What was the song?

864
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:40,483
He kept saying like,

865
01:12:40,816 --> 01:12:42,860
"Wake me up before you go-go"?

866
01:12:44,195 --> 01:12:45,196
Shit.

867
01:12:46,489 --> 01:12:47,489
Gotcha.

868
01:12:47,949 --> 01:12:50,034
80's means trouble.

869
01:12:50,952 --> 01:12:52,453
Code broken.

870
01:12:55,623 --> 01:12:56,863
Listen...

871
01:13:02,380 --> 01:13:04,382
The spot under Lancaster looks good.

872
01:13:05,049 --> 01:13:06,926
- You got a jacket in your pack?
- Yeah.

873
01:13:07,009 --> 01:13:08,970
Okay, get it. It's time to go.

874
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:23,001
<i>...mandatory curfew</i>

875
01:13:23,025 --> 01:13:25,528
<i>to fight the infection and insurrection.</i>

876
01:13:28,489 --> 01:13:30,700
<i>Observe mandatory curfew</i>

877
01:13:30,783 --> 01:13:33,494
<i>to fight infection and insurrection.</i>

878
01:14:22,585 --> 01:14:25,254
Holy shit. I'm actually outside.

879
01:14:25,338 --> 01:14:26,756
- Jesus Christ.
- Oh, shit.

880
01:14:29,925 --> 01:14:32,970
Okay, we're gonna take
the left edge around the buffer zone.

881
01:14:33,596 --> 01:14:35,640
You stay close and you follow my lead.

882
01:14:36,557 --> 01:14:37,557
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

883
01:14:39,101 --> 01:14:40,101
Let's go.

884
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:12,361
What the hell?

885
01:16:12,445 --> 01:16:14,071
Hey! Don't move.

886
01:16:15,823 --> 01:16:16,866
Don't move!

887
01:16:23,205 --> 01:16:24,205
You gotta be shitting me.

888
01:16:24,874 --> 01:16:26,709
- Okay, let's talk this out.
- Turn around.

889
01:16:26,792 --> 01:16:28,919
- Hold on...
- Get on your fucking knees.

890
01:16:29,003 --> 01:16:30,647
- Now hold on...
- What did I fucking tell you, man?

891
01:16:30,671 --> 01:16:33,299
I said stay the fuck home.
Get on your knees!

892
01:16:34,216 --> 01:16:36,010
Just get on your knees.

893
01:16:36,093 --> 01:16:38,471
Listen, you let us do this run,

894
01:16:38,929 --> 01:16:40,389
we'll split the cards with you.

895
01:16:40,473 --> 01:16:41,640
- Oh, will you?
- Yeah.

896
01:16:41,724 --> 01:16:44,518
I'm so blessed.
Hands on your head. Eyes forward.

897
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:46,520
Hands on your head!

898
01:16:50,107 --> 01:16:52,568
- Really, man?
- Yep. We're doing this by the book.

899
01:16:53,736 --> 01:16:54,904
Jesus Christ.

900
01:16:55,362 --> 01:16:56,864
All right. What about three-quarters?

901
01:16:58,365 --> 01:17:00,493
Unauthorized exit.
They'll hang you for that.

902
01:17:00,576 --> 01:17:02,411
Fine. Everything off of this run,

903
01:17:02,495 --> 01:17:04,789
- and half off on all of the pills.
- Half off?

904
01:17:05,456 --> 01:17:06,456
All off.

905
01:17:06,457 --> 01:17:09,543
Risk my job for half off.
Out of your fucking mind.

906
01:17:09,627 --> 01:17:11,712
Ellie! Ellie, what the...

907
01:17:11,796 --> 01:17:13,172
Fucking bitch!

908
01:17:15,299 --> 01:17:17,301
- Get out of the fucking way!
- Whoa. Whoa.

909
01:17:19,136 --> 01:17:20,137
We can fix this.

910
01:17:20,846 --> 01:17:21,846
Move.

911
01:17:25,976 --> 01:17:27,061
Move.

912
01:18:04,682 --> 01:18:06,308
No, no! No, I'm not sick!

913
01:18:06,392 --> 01:18:08,894
- Joel! Joel!
- I am not sick!

914
01:18:08,978 --> 01:18:11,730
Look! Look! This is three weeks old.

915
01:18:11,814 --> 01:18:13,148
Nobody lasts more than a day!

916
01:18:13,232 --> 01:18:14,900
Does this look a day old to you?

917
01:18:15,651 --> 01:18:17,671
- You would've killed me!
- I should fucking kill you!

918
01:18:17,695 --> 01:18:18,946
When did it happen?

919
01:18:19,029 --> 01:18:20,909
It doesn't matter.
You have to trust me!

920
01:18:20,990 --> 01:18:23,409
They're gonna catch us if we don't run!

921
01:18:24,910 --> 01:18:26,245
Joel, we gotta move.

922
01:18:26,579 --> 01:18:28,205
We gotta move, Joel!

923
01:18:40,509 --> 01:18:41,552
Joel!

924
01:19:33,103 --> 01:19:36,607
<i>I'm taking a ride with my best friend</i>

925
01:19:40,903 --> 01:19:45,658
<i>I hope he never lets me down again</i>

926
01:19:49,995 --> 01:19:53,958
<i>He knows where he's taking me</i>

927
01:19:54,375 --> 01:19:58,462
<i>Taking me where I want to be</i>

928
01:19:59,004 --> 01:20:03,801
<i>I'm taking a ride with my best friend</i>

929
01:20:17,106 --> 01:20:19,817
<i>We're flying high</i>

930
01:20:20,192 --> 01:20:24,321
<i>We're watching the world pass us by</i>

931
01:20:26,782 --> 01:20:28,909
<i>Never want to come down</i>

932
01:20:28,993 --> 01:20:33,163
<i>Never want to put my feet back
Down on the ground</i>
