1
00:00:08,552 --> 00:00:09,696
<i>And that's your biggest worry?</i>

2
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,864
<i>Yes, any kind
of virus.</i>

3
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:13,348
<i>But most probably
something similar to influenza.</i>

4
00:00:13,432 --> 00:00:14,433
<i>Because of air travel.</i>

5
00:00:14,516 --> 00:00:15,474
<i>Through the air.</i>

6
00:00:15,475 --> 00:00:17,019
- Coughing...
- I'm sorry.

7
00:00:17,102 --> 00:00:18,812
I meant people. On planes.

8
00:00:18,896 --> 00:00:20,456
That was something you described
in your book.

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,442
Yes, a new virus
in Madagascar, say, could be in Chicago

10
00:00:23,525 --> 00:00:24,526
within a matter of weeks,

11
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:27,571
and we end up with a global pandemic.
Pan meaning "all."

12
00:00:27,654 --> 00:00:29,948
The whole world becomes sick
all at once.

13
00:00:31,283 --> 00:00:33,827
And, Dr. Neuman,
you're also an epidemiologist.

14
00:00:33,911 --> 00:00:34,912
I presume the prospect

15
00:00:34,995 --> 00:00:36,848
of a viral pandemic keeps you up
at night as well.

16
00:00:36,872 --> 00:00:38,165
- No.
- No?

17
00:00:38,248 --> 00:00:40,000
- No.
- All right, well, that's our show.

18
00:00:41,084 --> 00:00:43,879
No, mankind has been
at war with the virus from the start.

19
00:00:43,962 --> 00:00:47,174
Sometimes, millions of people die,
as in an actual war.

20
00:00:47,257 --> 00:00:49,676
But in the end, we always win.

21
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,013
Just to be clear, you do think
microorganisms pose a threat.

22
00:00:53,263 --> 00:00:55,057
Oh, in the most dire terms.

23
00:00:55,641 --> 00:00:57,184
- Bacteria.
- No.

24
00:00:57,267 --> 00:00:59,061
- You like saying no.
- Yes.

25
00:01:00,646 --> 00:01:02,522
Not bacteria. Not viruses.

26
00:01:02,606 --> 00:01:04,399
- So?
- Fungus.

27
00:01:06,276 --> 00:01:08,070
Yes, that's the usual response.

28
00:01:08,153 --> 00:01:09,863
Fungi seem harmless enough.

29
00:01:09,947 --> 00:01:11,657
Many species know otherwise.

30
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,910
Because there are some fungi
who seek not to kill,

31
00:01:15,244 --> 00:01:16,453
but to control.

32
00:01:16,536 --> 00:01:19,164
Let me ask you,
where do we get LSD from?

33
00:01:19,248 --> 00:01:21,166
Where do you get it from?

34
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,460
It comes from ergot, a fungus.

35
00:01:23,543 --> 00:01:25,837
Psilocybin, also a fungus.

36
00:01:25,921 --> 00:01:29,800
Viruses can make us ill,
but fungi can alter our very minds.

37
00:01:29,883 --> 00:01:31,927
There's a fungus that infects insects.

38
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,887
Gets inside an ant, for example,

39
00:01:33,971 --> 00:01:37,182
travels through its circulatory system
to the ant's brain,

40
00:01:37,266 --> 00:01:39,142
and then floods it with hallucinogens,

41
00:01:39,226 --> 00:01:42,521
thus bending the ant's mind to its will.

42
00:01:42,604 --> 00:01:44,564
The fungus starts to direct
the ant's behavior,

43
00:01:44,648 --> 00:01:46,275
telling it where to go, what to do,

44
00:01:46,358 --> 00:01:48,402
like a puppeteer with a marionette.

45
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,945
And it gets worse.

46
00:01:50,028 --> 00:01:51,405
The fungus needs food to live,

47
00:01:51,488 --> 00:01:54,825
so it begins to devour
its host from within,

48
00:01:54,908 --> 00:01:57,411
replacing the ant's flesh with its own,

49
00:01:57,494 --> 00:01:59,329
but it doesn't let its victim die.

50
00:01:59,413 --> 00:02:04,584
No, it keeps its puppet alive
by preventing decomposition.

51
00:02:05,002 --> 00:02:08,046
- How? Where do we get penicillin from?
- Fungus.

52
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,067
Dr. Schoenheiss, you're in distress.

53
00:02:11,091 --> 00:02:14,052
Fungal infection of this kind is real,
but not in humans.

54
00:02:14,136 --> 00:02:16,054
True, fungi cannot survive

55
00:02:16,138 --> 00:02:19,891
if its host's internal temperature
is over 94 degrees.

56
00:02:19,975 --> 00:02:22,519
And currently, there are no reasons
for fungi to evolve

57
00:02:22,602 --> 00:02:24,289
to be able to withstand
higher temperatures.

58
00:02:24,313 --> 00:02:25,498
But what if that were to change?

59
00:02:25,522 --> 00:02:28,317
What if, for instance,

60
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,819
the world were to get slightly warmer?

61
00:02:31,445 --> 00:02:34,531
Well, now there is reason to evolve.

62
00:02:34,614 --> 00:02:38,869
One gene mutates and an <i>ascomycete,
candida,</i> ergot,

63
00:02:38,952 --> 00:02:41,955
<i>cordyceps, aspergillus,</i>
any one of them could become

64
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:44,082
capable of burrowing into our brains

65
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,543
and taking control,
not of millions of us,

66
00:02:46,626 --> 00:02:47,836
but billions of us.

67
00:02:48,378 --> 00:02:51,214
Billions of puppets with poisoned minds

68
00:02:51,298 --> 00:02:54,051
permanently fixed on one unifying goal:

69
00:02:54,426 --> 00:02:58,597
to spread the infection
to every last human alive

70
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,973
by any means necessary.

71
00:03:00,057 --> 00:03:01,534
And there are no treatments for this.

72
00:03:01,558 --> 00:03:04,019
No preventatives, no cures.

73
00:03:04,102 --> 00:03:06,938
They don't exist.
It's not even possible to make them.

74
00:03:08,482 --> 00:03:09,733
So, if that happens...

75
00:03:11,777 --> 00:03:12,861
We lose.

76
00:03:17,366 --> 00:03:18,450
We'll be back.

77
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,261
Alarm.

78
00:05:02,804 --> 00:05:03,930
Alarm!

79
00:05:20,447 --> 00:05:22,866
- Where's the pancake mix?
- Oh, was I...

80
00:05:23,241 --> 00:05:24,576
Yeah, I was. Sorry.

81
00:05:24,743 --> 00:05:26,411
I was gonna make you birthday pancakes.

82
00:05:26,495 --> 00:05:27,746
I swear.

83
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:29,456
You know I don't really like pancakes.

84
00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:32,083
I know you don't like them.
It was for my benefit.

85
00:05:36,213 --> 00:05:37,213
Vitamin C.

86
00:05:46,056 --> 00:05:47,766
You get your homework done?

87
00:05:50,185 --> 00:05:51,186
Fractions?

88
00:05:54,231 --> 00:05:56,441
- How old are you again?
- Thirty-six.

89
00:05:57,526 --> 00:06:00,246
- You're gonna have to wear diapers soon.
- Who says I don't already?

90
00:06:03,532 --> 00:06:04,448
Shell.

91
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:05,575
Calcium.

92
00:06:06,326 --> 00:06:07,326
Lovely.

93
00:06:09,037 --> 00:06:10,306
Is there enough for Uncle Tommy?

94
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,706
Well, there would've been.

95
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:14,583
Hey.

96
00:06:14,584 --> 00:06:15,984
You're still alive, you old fucker.

97
00:06:16,336 --> 00:06:17,629
Aw. He loves you.

98
00:06:17,712 --> 00:06:19,589
He's dependent on me. Not the same.

99
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,132
I think it's the same.

100
00:06:21,216 --> 00:06:23,552
It's definitely the same.
I thought we was having pancakes.

101
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:25,780
We'll pick you somethin' up on the road.

102
00:06:25,804 --> 00:06:28,014
- Concrete guys gonna be there?
- Yeah, they said maybe.

103
00:06:28,098 --> 00:06:31,184
Maybe? We can't frame until we pour.
We're not getting paid until we frame.

104
00:06:31,268 --> 00:06:33,454
Well, we could bring someone else on,
get the job done faster.

105
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:36,198
No, no. I'm not splitting this job.
I barely wanna split it with you.

106
00:06:36,815 --> 00:06:37,816
We could work a double.

107
00:06:38,191 --> 00:06:40,694
- Literally? Today?
- I know. I'll be done by 9:00.

108
00:06:40,777 --> 00:06:42,112
By 9:00, right?

109
00:06:42,821 --> 00:06:43,821
Yeah.

110
00:06:45,073 --> 00:06:46,241
I'll bring back a cake.

111
00:06:46,866 --> 00:06:47,866
I promise.

112
00:06:50,495 --> 00:06:52,831
...<i>continued
disturbances in Jakarta,</i>

113
00:06:52,914 --> 00:06:54,249
<i>but are advising US citizens...</i>

114
00:06:54,332 --> 00:06:56,376
Jakarta. Where is that, Middle East?

115
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:58,437
It doesn't ring a bell.
It's definitely a country.

116
00:06:58,461 --> 00:07:00,672
- Or maybe part of Asia?
- Jakarta isn't a country.

117
00:07:00,755 --> 00:07:03,425
Being a part of Asia isn't
mutually exclusive with being a country,

118
00:07:03,508 --> 00:07:05,427
and in fact,
it's the capital of Indonesia.

119
00:07:05,927 --> 00:07:08,013
Shit. Hope for us yet.

120
00:07:14,853 --> 00:07:15,853
All right.

121
00:07:16,646 --> 00:07:18,315
Finish up quick, we'll drop you off.

122
00:07:18,398 --> 00:07:20,984
- I'm still eating my eggshells.
- You got seven minutes.

123
00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:22,777
Your t-shirt's inside out.

124
00:07:26,114 --> 00:07:27,449
Shit.

125
00:07:29,993 --> 00:07:30,993
He's losing it.

126
00:08:12,243 --> 00:08:14,329
Sarah!

127
00:08:20,502 --> 00:08:21,586
Hey, neighbor!

128
00:08:22,295 --> 00:08:23,296
Oh, hi.

129
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,717
Connie was asking after you,
since you haven't been over in a while.

130
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:29,177
You make 'em happy.

131
00:08:30,595 --> 00:08:33,890
I could come by after school,
but just for, like, a little bit.

132
00:08:33,973 --> 00:08:35,266
She'll take whatcha got.

133
00:08:35,684 --> 00:08:37,894
Y'all can bake or whatever.

134
00:08:38,311 --> 00:08:39,437
Speaking of,

135
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:41,564
we got a lot of extra here.

136
00:08:41,648 --> 00:08:43,149
Y'all want some biscuits?

137
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,694
Dad, you love biscuits.

138
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,533
I do.

139
00:08:51,616 --> 00:08:52,951
But I'm on Atkins.

140
00:08:53,493 --> 00:08:56,121
- On what now?
- It's a... You know what?

141
00:08:56,204 --> 00:08:57,872
We gotta run, but Sarah'll be by later.

142
00:08:57,956 --> 00:08:59,582
She'll stay as long as you want,

143
00:09:00,417 --> 00:09:01,918
tell you all about Atkins.

144
00:09:02,001 --> 00:09:04,003
Great! I'll let Connie know.

145
00:09:04,713 --> 00:09:05,713
Solid.

146
00:09:09,134 --> 00:09:11,946
Can't tell you how exciting it was
listening to that fucking conversation.

147
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:12,971
Put that out.

148
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:15,724
Happy birthday to you.

149
00:09:26,025 --> 00:09:29,195
I want you to write this diagram out
exactly as I have it.

150
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,906
Always subject and predicate,

151
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,658
verb and noun.

152
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:37,370
Okay? The sentence is,
"Where are you going?" Subject is "You".

153
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:39,330
"You are going",

154
00:09:40,165 --> 00:09:41,624
predicate.

155
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,251
"Where", adverb.

156
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:45,879
You see it? Okay.
I have some nods, shaking of heads.

157
00:09:45,962 --> 00:09:47,922
I swear you will use this later in life.

158
00:09:48,006 --> 00:09:49,799
Believe me, that's why you're here.

159
00:09:49,883 --> 00:09:51,009
Okay? So...

160
00:09:57,515 --> 00:09:59,235
Yes, you need
to know this!

161
00:09:59,267 --> 00:10:01,227
Yes, it's on your test next week!

162
00:10:01,978 --> 00:10:05,523
Homework is due end of class tomorrow!

163
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:01,119
Twenty.

164
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:02,579
That's it?

165
00:11:02,831 --> 00:11:03,957
Okay, 30.

166
00:11:05,124 --> 00:11:06,167
Twenty's good.

167
00:11:06,251 --> 00:11:08,461
It's a spring. I'll do it right now.

168
00:11:27,897 --> 00:11:30,066
All day. I swear.

169
00:11:33,152 --> 00:11:34,152
We're closing.

170
00:11:35,989 --> 00:11:37,240
We're done for today.

171
00:11:37,323 --> 00:11:38,908
It's 3:15, we close at 7:00.

172
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,873
- I'm very sorry. He cannot finish.
- I'm already finished.

173
00:11:48,877 --> 00:11:50,169
You should go home.

174
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,649
- There you are, sweetie.
- Sorry.

175
00:12:11,733 --> 00:12:13,026
I was getting worried.

176
00:12:13,109 --> 00:12:14,903
I was getting something for my dad.

177
00:12:15,695 --> 00:12:16,738
Hi, Mercy.

178
00:12:18,948 --> 00:12:22,243
Hey, is everything okay?
Like, on the news?

179
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,703
Like what, hon?

180
00:12:24,329 --> 00:12:27,540
Well, no, there was just a lot of police
and stuff on the road today.

181
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,459
Well, that's true every day, isn't it?

182
00:12:29,876 --> 00:12:32,128
People out there need
to get right with Jesus.

183
00:12:32,211 --> 00:12:36,299
Three nails plus one cross
equals four-given.

184
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:39,427
I was thinking we'd make some cookies.

185
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,678
Chocolate chip?

186
00:12:41,262 --> 00:12:42,262
Raisin.

187
00:12:51,022 --> 00:12:53,191
Come on, Mama. It's green.

188
00:12:53,274 --> 00:12:54,754
You love that.

189
00:12:55,401 --> 00:12:56,653
Here we go!

190
00:12:58,154 --> 00:12:59,739
I don't know why I talk to her.

191
00:12:59,822 --> 00:13:01,366
She's completely deaf.

192
00:13:30,478 --> 00:13:31,562
Wanna give me a hand?

193
00:13:31,646 --> 00:13:32,855
Be right there!

194
00:13:55,128 --> 00:13:56,462
Hey, Mrs. Adler?

195
00:13:56,546 --> 00:13:58,089
Could I borrow this?

196
00:14:00,842 --> 00:14:02,385
Yeah, sure.

197
00:14:02,844 --> 00:14:04,053
It's one of Danny's.

198
00:14:05,346 --> 00:14:07,265
You know what?
My dad's gonna be back real soon.

199
00:14:07,348 --> 00:14:09,058
- I should go.
- You sure?

200
00:14:09,142 --> 00:14:11,561
- Yeah.
- Well, then you're taking some cookies.

201
00:15:00,777 --> 00:15:03,088
<i>No comment today
from the Austin Police Department</i>

202
00:15:03,112 --> 00:15:06,199
<i>regarding a rash of violent incidents
across the city,</i>

203
00:15:06,282 --> 00:15:09,535
<i>some suggesting a new street drug
may be to blame.</i>

204
00:15:09,619 --> 00:15:13,164
<i>More on that when we return,
with Manuela Sanchez reporting live...</i>

205
00:15:20,546 --> 00:15:22,048
You locked the door for once.

206
00:15:22,715 --> 00:15:24,717
- Good job.
- Yeah.

207
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:31,516
- It's 10:00.
- I know.

208
00:15:32,016 --> 00:15:35,061
They gave us the wrong size
for the headers.

209
00:15:36,479 --> 00:15:38,314
That doesn't mean anything to you.
I'm sorry.

210
00:15:39,315 --> 00:15:40,315
Where's the cake?

211
00:15:41,234 --> 00:15:43,194
- Shit.
- Come on, man.

212
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:44,557
I'll get us one tomorrow.

213
00:15:44,821 --> 00:15:47,657
Swear? Or you don't get your present.

214
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,992
- You got me a present?
- Swear.

215
00:15:50,827 --> 00:15:51,828
On my life.

216
00:15:59,544 --> 00:16:00,545
Wow.

217
00:16:04,674 --> 00:16:05,674
Fixed it for you.

218
00:16:13,349 --> 00:16:14,642
- Did you?
- What?

219
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:15,852
I don't hear anything.

220
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:18,311
That was lame.

221
00:16:18,354 --> 00:16:20,189
- You're lame.
- Yeah, I know.

222
00:16:21,691 --> 00:16:23,109
Where'd you get the money for this?

223
00:16:23,693 --> 00:16:25,528
Drugs. I sell hardcore drugs.

224
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:26,696
It's better than what I do.

225
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:29,115
It was only $20, which I stole from you.

226
00:16:30,616 --> 00:16:31,826
I could've stolen $60,

227
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:33,804
but I put the change back
because I'm an honest thief.

228
00:16:33,828 --> 00:16:35,955
- Hmm.
- Besides, it's the thought that counts.

229
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,249
And you were never gonna
do it for yourself, so.

230
00:16:43,713 --> 00:16:44,713
Thank you.

231
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,550
There's one more.

232
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:52,763
Borrowed it from the Adlers.

233
00:16:52,847 --> 00:16:54,891
Oh, this is the one
with the deleted scenes.

234
00:16:54,974 --> 00:16:57,018
Yeah, imagine how bad those have to be.

235
00:16:57,101 --> 00:16:59,187
Come on, pop it in.
While it's still your birthday.

236
00:17:08,988 --> 00:17:10,823
- Don't fall asleep.
- 'Course, I won't.

237
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:12,953
It's too riveting.

238
00:17:34,722 --> 00:17:35,638
Hello?

239
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,058
<i>Joel, it's me.</i>

240
00:17:37,141 --> 00:17:38,267
<i>I'm okay.</i>

241
00:17:39,227 --> 00:17:40,895
- Yeah?
<i>- But I'm in jail.</i>

242
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,523
- God damn it.
<i>- Wasn't my fault this time.</i>

243
00:17:44,607 --> 00:17:47,485
<i>I was at the bar, some guy goes crazy,
starts swinging at a waitress,</i>

244
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:49,368
<i>I stepped in, knocked him out,
cops show up...</i>

245
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:50,780
<i>Look, it doesn't fucking matter.</i>

246
00:17:50,863 --> 00:17:52,281
<i>- You gotta bail me out.</i>
- Now?

247
00:17:52,365 --> 00:17:53,842
<i>It's Friday,
you don't get me out tonight,</i>

248
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:54,909
<i>I'm in here all weekend.</i>

249
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:56,994
<i>It's a fucking madhouse, Joel.</i>

250
00:17:57,078 --> 00:17:59,580
<i>- I gotta get out.</i>
- Which jail? Travis County?

251
00:17:59,664 --> 00:18:00,915
<i>Yeah, on 10th.</i>

252
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:03,542
- God damn it, Tommy.
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>

253
00:18:05,628 --> 00:18:06,629
<i>Please.</i>

254
00:18:07,922 --> 00:18:08,922
Okay.

255
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,466
Fucking idiot.

256
00:19:13,321 --> 00:19:14,321
Dad?

257
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:24,622
Dad?

258
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:46,687
<i>Law enforcement
and emergency services are in the area</i>

259
00:19:46,771 --> 00:19:49,023
<i>and will be in contact
with further instructions.</i>

260
00:19:51,192 --> 00:19:53,402
<i>Stay indoors. Law enforcement...</i>

261
00:20:00,618 --> 00:20:02,328
Easy. Easy, Mercy.

262
00:20:03,496 --> 00:20:04,830
What are you doing out here, boy?

263
00:20:33,109 --> 00:20:35,029
Come on, let's get you home.

264
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,698
Come on, Mercy. Please.

265
00:20:40,825 --> 00:20:41,867
Mercy!

266
00:20:53,129 --> 00:20:54,255
Mrs. Adler?

267
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:16,318
Mrs. Adler?

268
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,391
Mrs. Adler?

269
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:03,072
Help me.

270
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:55,709
Get in the truck! Right now!

271
00:22:56,252 --> 00:22:57,628
Move!

272
00:23:09,139 --> 00:23:10,182
What are we doing, Joel?

273
00:23:26,532 --> 00:23:28,826
- You killed her.
- Baby, I'm sorry.

274
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:30,703
- Joel, we gotta go.
- Sarah, listen to me.

275
00:23:31,078 --> 00:23:32,496
It's not just the Adlers.

276
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,664
But we're gonna be brave,

277
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:35,587
and we're gonna get outta this.

278
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:37,668
Hey. Let's go. Come on.

279
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:39,670
Get in.

280
00:23:41,505 --> 00:23:42,506
Joel?

281
00:23:42,965 --> 00:23:44,717
Denise, you get back inside the house!

282
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,886
- You lock your doors! Now!
- Come on, get in!

283
00:23:57,062 --> 00:23:58,647
- Get your seat belt on.
- Hold on.

284
00:24:02,526 --> 00:24:04,153
Jesus Christ, Joel!

285
00:24:08,532 --> 00:24:10,326
- You take 71.
- 71, I know.

286
00:24:19,543 --> 00:24:20,586
- Daddy...
- We don't know.

287
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:23,088
They're saying it's a virus.
Some kind of parasite.

288
00:24:23,422 --> 00:24:24,715
Is it from terrorists?

289
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:26,884
We don't know.

290
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:29,678
- Are we sick?
- No. Of course not.

291
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:30,971
Why did things blow up?

292
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,681
No cellphone, no radio.

293
00:24:33,349 --> 00:24:34,868
A minute ago, newsman wouldn't shut up.

294
00:24:34,892 --> 00:24:36,492
- How do you know?
- What?

295
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,050
How do you know we're not sick?

296
00:24:39,104 --> 00:24:41,224
They're saying
it's mostly people in the city.

297
00:24:41,649 --> 00:24:43,400
That's why they got
the highway blocked off.

298
00:24:47,112 --> 00:24:48,112
God.

299
00:24:48,656 --> 00:24:49,740
That's Jimmy's place.

300
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:01,377
The Adlers would take Nana into the city

301
00:25:02,002 --> 00:25:03,337
to the hospital for stuff.

302
00:25:03,796 --> 00:25:06,173
That's right. They would.
That's probably why.

303
00:25:09,093 --> 00:25:12,638
But, you'd have to go a lot, right?

304
00:25:13,138 --> 00:25:14,306
We're fine. Trust me.

305
00:25:18,268 --> 00:25:19,269
All right.

306
00:25:25,025 --> 00:25:26,276
Here! Right here!

307
00:25:26,694 --> 00:25:28,153
- Hey!
- What are you doing?

308
00:25:28,237 --> 00:25:30,364
- They got a kid, Joel.
- So do we. Keep driving.

309
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:32,807
- Please, no! No, no!
- We could put them in the back.

310
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:37,830
Somebody else will come along.

311
00:25:48,966 --> 00:25:51,176
Fuck! Everybody had
the same fucking idea.

312
00:25:52,553 --> 00:25:55,431
- I can't get through this.
- All right. Let's think it through.

313
00:25:55,514 --> 00:25:56,866
- Fuck!
- All right, take the field.

314
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,767
We cut across
and we pick up on the west side.

315
00:25:58,851 --> 00:26:00,561
Yeah, yeah.
West, west, all right.

316
00:26:00,644 --> 00:26:01,645
All right, hang on.

317
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,411
Shit! Fucking Army.

318
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:19,374
- Isn't that good?
- It's good for them,

319
00:26:19,455 --> 00:26:21,415
but that's the highway
we're trying to get to.

320
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:22,809
All right, keep moving.
Head north.

321
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:24,769
- Could be a lot of people.
- Well, we can't go south,

322
00:26:24,793 --> 00:26:27,313
we can't go east, we can't go west.
Hell else we supposed to go?

323
00:26:28,922 --> 00:26:29,922
Tommy, come on!

324
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:38,056
Yeah, I know that place.

325
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,659
- This can work.
- Yeah, but then what?

326
00:26:39,683 --> 00:26:41,518
I don't know. Mexico. Just far.

327
00:26:41,602 --> 00:26:44,897
- Far as we can. How much gas?
- Three-quarter tank.

328
00:26:45,481 --> 00:26:47,801
Go through town, golf course
by the river, straight across,

329
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:50,569
we pick up the highway
on the other side of the blockade,

330
00:26:50,694 --> 00:26:51,694
then we're out.

331
00:27:00,412 --> 00:27:01,413
Maybe it's everywhere.

332
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:05,167
Maybe there's nowhere to go.

333
00:27:10,923 --> 00:27:12,341
What the fuck?

334
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,855
Son of a bitch. Gotta go around.

335
00:27:27,189 --> 00:27:28,190
Grab something!

336
00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:45,499
All right, keep going, keep going.

337
00:27:45,582 --> 00:27:46,750
Shit. Tommy!

338
00:27:51,046 --> 00:27:52,214
Tommy, you can't stop here.

339
00:27:52,881 --> 00:27:54,359
- I can't drive through 'em all.
- Are you serious?

340
00:27:54,383 --> 00:27:55,384
Just keep going!

341
00:28:00,764 --> 00:28:02,182
Go, go, go. Back, back,

342
00:28:02,266 --> 00:28:03,934
- back, back!
- I'm trying!

343
00:28:08,647 --> 00:28:10,065
Tommy, go faster! We gotta go!

344
00:28:10,148 --> 00:28:11,501
I'm trying!
There's nowhere to fucking go!

345
00:28:11,525 --> 00:28:12,794
- Find an alley!
- What alley?

346
00:28:12,818 --> 00:28:14,546
- There's people everywhere!
- Roll the fuck over them!

347
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:15,988
We gotta get off this street now!

348
00:28:16,071 --> 00:28:17,340
That's what I'm trying to do, Joel.

349
00:28:17,364 --> 00:28:19,164
We're gonna be okay.
Just keep driving.

350
00:28:19,241 --> 00:28:20,242
Dad?

351
00:28:21,285 --> 00:28:22,327
Holy shit!

352
00:28:23,328 --> 00:28:25,497
Move. Move!

353
00:28:57,738 --> 00:28:59,823
Sarah, Sarah.

354
00:28:59,907 --> 00:29:01,241
Stay right there. Don't move.

355
00:29:02,618 --> 00:29:03,952
Tommy, you okay?

356
00:29:04,036 --> 00:29:04,952
Yeah, okay.

357
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:20,719
Sarah, don't look.

358
00:29:21,428 --> 00:29:23,263
You look at me, okay?

359
00:29:23,347 --> 00:29:25,267
I'm sorry, baby, I know, I know.

360
00:29:25,307 --> 00:29:26,576
Come here. Put your arms around me.

361
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,768
Come here, come here.

362
00:29:28,644 --> 00:29:30,854
I got you. I got you.

363
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,480
Got you.

364
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:37,027
Are you okay? Are you okay?

365
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,695
- My ankle.
- All right, okay.

366
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:41,019
We gotta get off the street! Shit!

367
00:29:45,285 --> 00:29:46,285
Tommy?

368
00:29:47,162 --> 00:29:48,246
Tommy!

369
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:49,831
Tommy!

370
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:53,460
Head to the river! I'll find a way.

371
00:29:54,503 --> 00:29:55,663
Get her outta here, Joel! Go!

372
00:29:57,798 --> 00:29:59,275
- We can't leave him.
- He'll be fine.

373
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:00,509
- Can you run?
- No.

374
00:30:02,219 --> 00:30:03,579
- You keep your eyes on me.
- Okay.

375
00:30:03,637 --> 00:30:04,553
- Okay?
- Okay.

376
00:30:04,554 --> 00:30:05,764
And don't look anywhere else.

377
00:30:06,473 --> 00:30:07,473
All right.

378
00:31:05,866 --> 00:31:07,743
It's okay, baby. You're safe.

379
00:31:08,452 --> 00:31:09,453
Don't move!

380
00:31:11,455 --> 00:31:14,041
- My daughter's hurt her ankle.
- Stop right there!

381
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:16,543
Okay.

382
00:31:17,294 --> 00:31:19,713
Easy now. We're not sick!

383
00:31:20,297 --> 00:31:22,966
I've got two civilians by the river,
one of them injured.

384
00:31:24,509 --> 00:31:25,510
Ankle.

385
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:27,846
What about Uncle Tommy?

386
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,223
We're gonna get you
somewhere safe first.

387
00:31:30,307 --> 00:31:31,987
- Then we'll go back for him, okay?
- Okay.

388
00:31:32,225 --> 00:31:33,727
- Okay.
- I'm sorry, repeat?

389
00:31:33,935 --> 00:31:35,729
Hey. No one told you to move.

390
00:31:37,773 --> 00:31:38,773
Yes, sir.

391
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:41,967
Yes, sir.

392
00:31:44,654 --> 00:31:45,697
Yes, sir.

393
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:51,536
We're not sick.

394
00:31:54,372 --> 00:31:55,457
Sir,

395
00:31:56,291 --> 00:31:58,001
we are not sick!

396
00:32:11,014 --> 00:32:12,014
I'm sorry.

397
00:32:13,475 --> 00:32:14,643
Please, don't.

398
00:32:24,486 --> 00:32:25,737
Oh, God.

399
00:32:31,326 --> 00:32:32,494
No.

400
00:32:32,786 --> 00:32:34,621
No, no. No.

401
00:32:35,747 --> 00:32:37,582
Okay. You're okay.

402
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:39,960
You're okay. Move your hand, baby.

403
00:32:40,043 --> 00:32:41,086
Move your hand.

404
00:32:47,801 --> 00:32:49,886
I know, baby, I know,
I know, I know, I know.

405
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:51,096
I know it hurts.

406
00:32:51,847 --> 00:32:54,349
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

407
00:32:54,432 --> 00:32:57,018
Come on, baby. You're okay, you're okay.

408
00:32:57,561 --> 00:33:00,939
I know, I know, I know, I know, baby,
I know, I know. I know this hurts.

409
00:33:01,606 --> 00:33:02,774
You're gonna be okay.

410
00:33:02,858 --> 00:33:06,528
All right. Baby, baby, listen to me.

411
00:33:06,611 --> 00:33:08,613
I gotta get you up, okay?

412
00:33:08,697 --> 00:33:09,697
I gotta get you up.

413
00:33:10,198 --> 00:33:12,117
All right? Come on.

414
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,077
You come on. I know, baby.

415
00:33:14,411 --> 00:33:16,997
No, no. I know, I know, I know,
I know, I know, I know.

416
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,080
Tommy, help me!

417
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:20,584
Joel.

418
00:33:22,002 --> 00:33:23,086
Come on, baby girl.

419
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:24,963
Come on, baby girl. I gotta get you up.

420
00:33:25,046 --> 00:33:26,173
Come on.

421
00:33:26,256 --> 00:33:27,382
Come on, we'll get up.

422
00:33:27,465 --> 00:33:29,785
Come on, baby girl.

423
00:33:30,218 --> 00:33:32,929
Come on, come on, please.

424
00:36:18,428 --> 00:36:20,108
We don't want you
falling out of the chair.

425
00:36:21,222 --> 00:36:22,265
What's your name?

426
00:36:24,517 --> 00:36:25,810
Are you alone?

427
00:36:31,941 --> 00:36:33,193
And...

428
00:36:34,235 --> 00:36:35,904
how did you get this?

429
00:36:39,449 --> 00:36:42,160
It's gonna be
a little tickle right here.

430
00:36:51,753 --> 00:36:54,172
What if I told you
that after we gave you some medicine,

431
00:36:54,714 --> 00:36:56,591
we're gonna find you
your favorite food to eat?

432
00:36:57,133 --> 00:36:58,218
Would you like that?

433
00:36:59,386 --> 00:37:02,222
And then we'll get you
some new clothes and toys,

434
00:37:02,972 --> 00:37:04,682
as many as you wanna play with.

435
00:37:09,521 --> 00:37:10,939
It's just a little needle.

436
00:37:12,774 --> 00:37:14,109
It's okay.

437
00:37:18,947 --> 00:37:19,989
You're safe.

438
00:38:24,804 --> 00:38:25,804
I can't.

439
00:39:05,803 --> 00:39:06,803
Ten.

440
00:39:17,815 --> 00:39:20,652
- You got anything else?
- Nothing today.

441
00:39:20,735 --> 00:39:24,864
Tomorrow, we got street sweeping,
or sewer maintenance.

442
00:39:25,365 --> 00:39:26,533
Which pays more?

443
00:39:27,116 --> 00:39:28,618
That'd be the one with the shit.

444
00:39:33,456 --> 00:39:34,874
Late crew. 4:00 p.m. start.

445
00:40:11,869 --> 00:40:15,206
...<i>violation
of EMC 342.3,</i>

446
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:17,709
<i>unauthorized exit

447
00:40:18,334 --> 00:40:23,298
<i>Maria Elisiano, violation of EMC 342.7,</i>

448
00:40:23,381 --> 00:40:26,426
<i>unauthorized entry
into a Quarantine Zone.</i>

449
00:40:26,509 --> 00:40:29,429
<i>Each of you have been tried

450
00:40:29,512 --> 00:40:33,600
<i>and each of you having been found guilty

451
00:40:33,683 --> 00:40:35,685

452
00:40:35,768 --> 00:40:40,023
<i>as empowered under the EMPA,
Article 1, Section 5...</i>

453
00:40:55,538 --> 00:40:56,538
Come on.

454
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:05,715
- Or I could just shoot you.
- Yeah, but then what would you do?

455
00:41:07,759 --> 00:41:09,010
You're short five.

456
00:41:29,614 --> 00:41:31,407
- Oxy?
- Hydro.

457
00:41:32,408 --> 00:41:33,785
- How old?
- Three months.

458
00:41:33,868 --> 00:41:35,763
- From Atlanta?
- I don't know where he gets 'em from.

459
00:41:35,787 --> 00:41:38,227
- I just know they're real.
- If it's real, it's from Atlanta.

460
00:41:38,498 --> 00:41:40,541
FEDRA's got a factory
down there in the QZ.

461
00:41:40,625 --> 00:41:42,877
Supposedly only makes two things.

462
00:41:44,671 --> 00:41:46,714
Pills and bullets, bullets and pills.

463
00:41:46,798 --> 00:41:49,151
Well, the more you shoot people,
the harder it is to sleep, I guess.

464
00:41:49,175 --> 00:41:51,219
Oh, you guess?

465
00:41:52,512 --> 00:41:53,513
You want 'em or not?

466
00:41:58,935 --> 00:42:00,478
I need the bag back.

467
00:42:05,191 --> 00:42:07,031
- How are we doing with the vehicle?
- All set.

468
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,986
Had to get one last guy in the depot
to buy in.

469
00:42:09,696 --> 00:42:10,863
Okay, how much?

470
00:42:10,947 --> 00:42:14,325
Four of them on that shift plus me,
600 total.

471
00:42:15,576 --> 00:42:18,079
Look, those trucks are shitheaped
for a reason.

472
00:42:18,162 --> 00:42:20,206
And they don't have
any batteries. I know.

473
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:23,584
I can see about 200 for the other guys,
200 for you.

474
00:42:26,045 --> 00:42:27,045
Deal.

475
00:42:28,589 --> 00:42:30,508
Hey. Do yourself a favor,

476
00:42:31,467 --> 00:42:33,227
stay off the streets
for the next few nights.

477
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,847
Fucking Fireflies been
blowing shit up all week.

478
00:42:36,389 --> 00:42:37,866
Two of our guys got shot this morning.

479
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:41,144
Boss has got us working doubles.
Guys are jumpy and tired.

480
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,188
It's easy to make a mistake in the dark.

481
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,526
Stay safe.

482
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:50,653
Yeah, you too.

483
00:43:11,716 --> 00:43:13,396
What do you want me
to say, Tess?

484
00:43:14,177 --> 00:43:16,304
I'm not asking you
to say anything.

485
00:43:18,181 --> 00:43:19,223
Sure.
