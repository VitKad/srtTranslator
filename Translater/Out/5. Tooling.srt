00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,990
ASP.NET Core can be developed using the tools used to develop any .NET

2
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:14,040
application. The most commonly used is Visual Studio by Microsoft.

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,250
It comes in a number of editions.

4
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:21,440
The downside of Visual Studio is that it only runs on Windows.

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,940
There is a separately developed Mac version, however,

6
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:29,010
with a slightly different development experience in which not all

7
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,040
the features of the Windows version are available.

8
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,140
Rider by JetBrains is an alternative to Visual Studio.

9
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,820
It runs cross platform on Windows,

10
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,610
Linux, and macOS, offering the same developer

11
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,740
experience across the different platforms.

12
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:55,440
Visual Studio and Rider are called IDEs, integrated development environments.

13
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,730
They have support for everything a developer needs such

14
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:02,170
as the ability to write and edit code, build it,

15
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:05,640
run it, debug it, and deploy it.

16
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,570
Visual Studio Code is also commonly used, but it is

17
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:14,440
different. It focuses more on code editing,

18
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,890
not just of the .NET languages,

19
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,640
but almost every programming language in existence.

20
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,040
You can still do all the other things I mentioned,

21
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,710
but it is not integrated in the tool, and that's why Visual Studio Code

22
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:35,730
is often used together with the command line interface or CLI tools .NET

23
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:41,340
offers. .NET on the command line is part of the software development

24
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:47,240
kit, or SDK, of .NET, and it can do a lot of things like create a new

25
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:53,630
build or running the code. Since it's the most commonly used tool among

26
00:01:53,630 --> 00:02:06,000
.NET developers, I will use Visual Studio during the coming code examples. In the next clip, we'll see how an ASP.NET Core application starts up.
