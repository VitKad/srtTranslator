Hello, and welcome.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:08,750
I'm Roland, and I've created a few other courses on the ASP.NET

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:14,110
Core topic in the past. This course is specifically about ASP.NET

4
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:20,870
Core 6 and is created with version 6.0. It's useful for any minor

5
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,840
version of ASP.NET Core 6.

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,380
Should you be looking for an older version, please take a look at

7
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:32,040
my author page to find a course relevant to you.

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,440
You probably know a bit about ASP.NET Core already.

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,070
Maybe you've seen a demo, played around with it, or maybe you've

10
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:44,750
seen some documentation, but let's start at the very beginning

11
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:49,140
anyway to give you the whole big picture.

12
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,440
Before I start, you will have to be aware of a couple of things.

13
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,230
First,

14
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:00,280
the intent of this course. It is meant as an overview of all that

15
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,290
ASP.NET Core is and what you can do with it.

16
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,140
That doesn't mean this will be a course with just slides.

17
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:14,000
I also show you code so that in addition to the theory, you gain a

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,540
good technical understanding of the different parts,

19
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:22,920
just not in a way that you can code along or start creating ASP.NET Core

20
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,940
applications right after watching this course. You'll need to watch additional

21
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:34,270
courses before you can do that. But at the very least, this course will

22
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:40,180
inspire you to make the right choices on what part of ASP.NET Core you could

23
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,940
zoom into next. In terms of knowledge,

24
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:48,580
we need a starting point in order to proceed. First of all,

25
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:53,970
I'm assuming that you know how the web works with HTTP, requests, and

26
00:01:53,970 --> 00:02:00,400
responses. You should have at least a basic understanding of how HTML and

27
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:05,930
CSS work because these technologies form the basis of every ASP.NET Core

28
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:12,170
application. I'm going to show you code examples. To understand them, I

29
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:17,790
also need you to know what .NET is, and you should be able to read the C#

30
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:20,540
programming language.

31
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,430
If you have knowledge gaps,

32
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:27,140
I would recommend watching other big picture courses around these topics

33
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:32,920
first. Depending on your learning style, looking at my code examples or

34
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:45,000
experimenting with them might be beneficial. If so, you can find all content in this GitHub repository.
