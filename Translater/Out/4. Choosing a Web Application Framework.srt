00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:07,260
ASP.NET Core is a great choice when you're in the market for a web application

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:14,290
framework. Here's why. You already got a taste of its wide range of application

3
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:22,580
styles, the multiple ways to create front and back‑end applications. You'll soon

4
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:26,140
see that no matter which one you choose,

5
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,140
the lower level engine is the same since they all run

6
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,040
on the same foundational framework.

7
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,020
This means you only have to learn the lower level anatomy once and apply

8
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:42,040
that knowledge to all styles. Later on in this module,

9
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,970
you will learn more about the anatomy.

10
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:48,790
ASP.NET Core is also open source.

11
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:53,840
That means it's not a black box in which you don't know what's going on.

12
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,230
Everything is transparent, and it's good for the continuation of the product

13
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:04,720
because both Microsoft and the community are working on it.

14
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,450
ASP.NET Core is among the best performing frameworks out there, and it

15
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,940
runs on multiple platforms such as Windows and Linux,

16
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:19,340
giving it the widest range of hosting options possible.

17
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,840
Modularity is also an important advantage.

18
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,520
It has a big feature set,

19
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:29,630
but almost every aspect of it is opt in. When you don't use it,

20
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:36,260
it costs nothing in terms of performance and memory.

21
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:42,080
ASP.NET Core is also built on top of .NET. That means that existing .NET

22
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,940
developers can use the complete library of classes they know and love

23
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:53,240
contained in .NET in their ASP.NET Core applications, using one of the .NET

24
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:58,790
programming languages where C# is the most common.

25
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:03,830
There are a lot of alternatives, which have one thing in common. They are

26
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:10,920
not running on .NET. ASP.NET Core is the obvious choice for .NET

27
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,530
developers. On other platforms, there is Node,js,

28
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,400
for example, with the Express framework. On Java,

29
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,210
there is a well‑known framework called Spring, and

30
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:26,440
there's Ruby on Rails and Django, just to name a few.

31
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,720
These are all great, but of course, they are for developers on the

32
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:42,000
platform they're running on. The bottom line, ASP.NET Core is the web application framework for .NET developers.
