00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:08,780
All frontâ€‘end application styles have one thing in common, the way the UI,

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:14,260
the pages or views can be designed. It is done using Razor. Razor is

3
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:20,840
basically HTML with the option to embed C# code. To show you what I mean,

4
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:28,980
here's the file called Error.cshtml from our Razor Pages example project. The

5
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,930
Razor Pages application style, of course, gets its name from the Razor we're

6
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:43,880
talking about in this clip. The cshtml extension stands for C# with HTML. In

7
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:50,570
the same way VBHTML files exist, Visual Basic with HTML. We'll soon see,

8
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:57,800
however, that in Blazor, Razor files simply have the extension razor. At

9
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:05,990
first glance, this Error.cshtml file seems to be just a normal HTML file. But

10
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:11,880
when you look closely, there is embedded C# code. For example,

11
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:18,020
there is this if statement that checks the boolean property, ShowRequestId, on

12
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:24,690
a model object. If it's true, a p HTML element is rendered, and that shows the

13
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:29,440
RequestId property, also from the model object.

14
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:34,740
Notice that every time we begin a C# statement or expression, the at sign

15
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:40,920
is used. If we leave out the at sign, it will just literally show

16
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,740
Model.RequestId and not evaluate it as an expression.

17
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,970
Code blocks are also possible by using the at sign, followed by

18
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:56,890
curly braces. In such a block, multiple lines of code can be

19
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,540
written, ending with a semicolon.

20
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,900
I could, for example, add a line that declares an error text

21
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:11,500
variable. I refer to it somewhere in my HTML markup. ASP.NET Core

22
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:16,110
will make sure that the code in Razor files is processed before

23
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,840
the browser shows it to the user.

24
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:27,000
Now it's about time I told you the specifics of the different application styles.
