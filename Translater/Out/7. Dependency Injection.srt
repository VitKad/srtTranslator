00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:07,280
I'm returning to the Program.cs file in the application. The part just

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:12,120
above the line that creates the app object, registers services in the

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:19,110
dependency injection container. Dependency injection is an essential part

4
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,790
of every ASP.NET Core application.

5
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:28,140
The container is a central place in which types can be registered.

6
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,530
Each instance of the type will have a lifetime,

7
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:35,240
which is determined at registration time.

8
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,240
Once the registration is done,

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:42,040
we can ask for an object instance anywhere in the application.

10
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:48,240
The object will be automatically instantiated when we first ask for it.

11
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:54,260
Builder.Services is the object to do the registration on before the actual

12
00:00:54,260 --> 00:01:00,760
application is started. AddRazorPages here is an extension method that

13
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:06,740
registers all needed types for the Razor Pages engine.

14
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,130
As you might remember,

15
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:14,840
Razor Pages is one of the application styles ASP.NET Core offers.

16
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,540
You can also register your own types in a dependency injection container.

17
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:32,000
You'll learn how to do that in the next module where I will show you the first demo application. I'm discussing the rest of Program.cs next.
