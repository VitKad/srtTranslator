Hello. I'm Roland Guijt, and welcome to my course, ASP.NET Core 6: Big

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,170
Picture. I'm a Microsoft MVP, independent consultant, and trainer based in

3
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:22,140
the Netherlands. If you want to know what ASP.NET Core is and what you can

4
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,510
do with it, this course is for you. We're covering technologies like Blazor,

5
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:35,470
MVC, Web API, gRPC, and SignalR, and I'm showing you sample applications for

6
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:41,960
each, explaining them step‑by‑step. Here, are some major topics I will talk

7
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:48,240
about, server‑rendered frontend applications with MVC and Razor pages,

8
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:53,780
client‑rendered frontend applications with Blazor, and backend APIs

9
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:59,520
with gRPC and Web API. By the end of this course, you'll be able to

10
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,440
determine if ASP.NET Core is for you, and more importantly, what it

11
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:09,000
contains and how each contained technology works. Before beginning

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,990
the course,

13
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,240
you should have a good understanding on how the web works with requests and

14
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:21,310
responses, have HTML knowledge, and experience with .NET and C#. Get ready

15
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:34,000
to unlock the wonderful world of ASP.NET Core with my course, ASP.NET Core 6: Big Picture, at Pluralsight.
